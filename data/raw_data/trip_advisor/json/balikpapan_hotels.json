The receptionist desk queue was unacceptably long, and there was no distinction between group and personal check-ins, causing even further delays. It was disappointing to see that the hotel did not prioritize guest satisfaction by employing more staff or adopting a more efficient check-in system.\n\nAdditionally, the hotel's policy of not allowing early check-ins is extremely inconvenient. This policy shows a lack of consideration for guests' schedules, which is unacceptable. As a result, we had to wait an unreasonable amount of time to check in and had no choice but to put my plans on hold.",

From the very first interaction with Huda from the Hotel who collected us at the airport until the farewell when he delivered us back to catch our flight, he and all the staff were so helpful and accommodating to our needs. We are an older couple and I use a walking stick. A special mention to Fitri in the front office who took great care when we had an issue with international banking and the Indonesian phone sim. The food and coffee was good, as was the service in the bar in the evenings. The location is great with E Walk shopping centre right next door.  We had a very comfortable stay here.",

      "text": "I have stayed in lots of hotels in Balikpapan. Different people have different preferences for hotels but, I recommend staying at this luxury hotel, Grand Jatra Hotel. I had never seen a five-star hotel as good as this in Balikpapan. Our stay at Grand Jatra Hotel Balikpapan was outstanding, we stayed on the sixth floor and the views above there were splendid. The parking area is spacious since it was next to the mall. The service of the hotel, which was excellent. The hotel staff was very welcoming and friendly, I had a wonderful experience at the hotel. Every staff member I encountered, from the check-in to the cleaning staff were delightful, impatient, and sincere to help me. Before I tell my little sister that the breakfast was already closed, she had run out the door. So we decided to eat at the mall. The location of the hotel is perfect, which is next to the mall. Because of that perfect location, We can easily go for food, shopping, etc. Overall it is a good hotel, but there is something that needs to be improved, for example, the WIFI connection and sometimes there are no soaps and towels.",

Some corporates have a discounted price with dinner/laundry packages.\n\nThings that should be improved:\n- Wi-Fi (the WiFi is so unstable)\n- Breakfast/Food, i have tasted better food in a 3 stars hotel to be honest.\n- Laundry Bag isn't free (well this is the first hotel that i stay, which the guests have to pay for bringing out the laundry bag!)",

And we just realized at night as I smell cigarettes getting stronger. \nThey were not well prepared, no towels and toiletries in my room, we need to ask TWICE!\nThe view of our rooms are very dissappointing. We faced blower machine and the roof of mall beside. Seriously? For IDR 850k? and my double bed was two single bed arranged in one bedsheet. how terrible!\n\n I also found HAIR in my bedsheets.\nin my children room, also we found hairs at bathroom and wastafel. Really???\n\nBreakfast.\nVariation : wide \nTaste : standard\nService : definitely not a 5 stars standard though the restaurant is very luxurious\n",

      "text": "Located not so far from the airport & next to shopping malls makes this hotel popular. I stayed 1 night, arrived at Balikpapan around 10 AM. I requested for an early check in at my reservation, but they could not give me one & had to wait until 1 PM. The malls helped me to kill time while waiting. Not impressed by the staffs attitude though, when arrived there were stairs at the entrance. I only brought a carry on luggage & easily manage to get through the stairs. Sadly, the security staffs at the entrance didn't do anything to help. I understand that they can not leave their post, but at least they could call concierge staff to help guests. I don't know what the guest would do if they bring big luggage, didn't see a ramp either near the entrance. After a while came back to check if room ready & told the Front Office that I will need 1 meeting room later on. They inform me to wait for the staff who handle the reservation, so I waited for almost an hour until someone showed up. Not impressed again with the long waiting. Since we were using the meeting room, we had free buffet lunch. I think the hotel breakfast food variety was way much better than the lunch. After the meeting, I called a staff asking a box to take the leftover food from tea  break. Again, we have to wait for another hour & made a call again. \nI could not say good things about the room, I think the room was outdated & need some refurbishment as well thorough cleaning. The chair had missing buttons, there were an obvious pen or pencil marks on the wardrobe door, also some stains on the bed sheet. When I put some stuffs at my room desk, I noticed there were ants on the surface. Called housekeeping to clean the desk once again. I left the room  to take a stroll around the hotel & check their pool & gym, which both looked great. When I came back, I could see the desk area had been cleaned. But I noticed there were still some ants at the desk & night stand near the bed. This time I waited for the housekeeping staff to show the ants, & found the source from the coffe/tea tray. Thankfully, they offered me to change room. They were nice enough to upgrade the room to deluxe one, and asked me to check the room condition before they moved my luggage. I was glad that this room was ant free. They also give us a late check out for the next day.\nI am sorry that I did not have a great time although I stayed only for a night at this hotel. If I had a better hotel option, probably I won't choose this place for the next time.",

But always sterile and lacking that personal touch.\nBlue Sky Hotel manages to capture all of that as you are immediately greeted by rustic antiques at the lobby, and make you feel right at home. The overall experience is simply incomparable. \n\nI've been accommodated in Blue Sky Hotel for months throughout and even after the pandemic, but have never felt home sick. Everything in this hotel is top notch - especially the food!\n\nThank you again to the Blue Sky team for your unparalleled hospitality, I will definitely be coming back.",

Did a business trip working there.\n\nLet's start, landing at sepinggan international airport, there is a pick up team with mr. sunyoto. (free service). Then, the trip to the hotel is only 10 minutes.\n\nArrived at the hotel I entered the room, and felt very comfortable and full of warmth and plus a very spacious room.\n\nThe next day, I had breakfast. The food provided, from Indonesian food, western food until Japanese food. My favorite, Soto Medan and sushi!\n\nOverall, I really enjoy all the services and facilities provided by Blue Sky Hotel Balikpapan.\n\nDo not forget! you can must try SPA massages & pool",

However the room was spotless and well maintained. My next two rooms were in the newer part. Both were spacious, clean and comfortable - one having a kitchenette and balcony. \n\nFood was good, but while on COVID quarantine the room service often arrived lukewarm, but given the large numbers of people ordering room service at the same time this may explain it. The only real complaint I had about the food was that when I ordered the burger, twice the burger came undercooked (raw in the middle) despite me ordering well done. However the rest of the meals were delicious, and I can recommend the food from the Japanese and Chinese on site restaurants. \n\nThe staff were excellent and very friendly. \n\nI would be delighted to return to this hotel if ever in Balikpapan again.

No sign of professionalism. The check in process was a drag. It was long. The lobby is nice though, spacious, clean, the elevator is small, it only fits maybe 5 pax max. The room we stayed in is spacious, clean, and quite nice. The amenities was complete. The bathtub though, need to be replaced. There was like corroded metal in it. Check it at room 521. Didn't get a chance to report that. But please, it needs to be handled seriously. The pool is nice, the breakfast is great. The check out process, it was longer than the check in process.",

Hallways well lit and no smell of old hotels.\n\nThe breakfast is definitely the best. With the very diverse menu available to the friendly service of the waiters.\n\nCheckin and checkout very easy and painless.\n\nI never had the chance to enjoy the seafood resto or the swimming pool. But from the sheer number of people in the pool I can tell they are making full use of that facility.\n\nHighly recommended for the sub 700rb category",

WiFi didn’t work well at all.\n\nBathroom was quite sparse - could have done with a couple of small towels and a hair dryer.\n\nBreakfast was mostly Asian with an egg station and toaster.\n\nThe big negative for me was the location - not the best of locations for a visitor, and quite a long way from anything.

There was only the female security who didn't help me with the suitcase & bags AT ALL even though she saw me babywearing my 1 y.o toddler. She didn't even intend to help or offering me a hand. She just greeted me with \"pagi\" & stayed at her place PLAYING CANDY CRUSH!!!! I saw with my own eyes when answering to her greeting.\n\nThe 3rd day I was here, 26 August 2022 at 08.00 AM. I was in the middle eating my breakfast, then my toddler needed to go to the bathroom. Then I asked one of the F&B waitress (again she was in her phone). I asked where the toilet was & I asked whether I can go back to the resto after I got my baby cleaned or not.. Then SHE LAUGHED & say \"Bisa (laughing) Kamer Berapa?\"\n\nTHIS IS HOSPITALITY BUSINESS.. YOU GUYS SHOULD REALLY IMPROVE THE MANNERS OF THE EMPLOYEES. I don't mind if I can't go back to the resto again AS LONG AS they deliver with good manners & words.\n\nAt the end I don't go back bcs It was such a mocking way to laugh the guest who asked nicely.\n\nPLEASE IMPROVE THE SERVICE, IMMEDIATELY.",

The rooms are very tired and feel very dirty with a bad smell of dampness I’ve noticed this in all rooms I’ve stayed in including what I would guess was a suite last summer . Room service menu has plenty listed on it but they don’t have much of what is on the menu and the food i very poor quality. The hotel looks nice on entry but it seems this is the only area that has been kept in good standard . Given the choice this hotel is far down the list for this area having stewed in most of the hotels in the area at some point over the last few years .I have had no issues with the staff they seem helpful and it looks like they are working with what the company have given them. This is a 2-3 star hotel dressed up a little to give the impression of something better",

They also applied health protocol in the restaurant.

Panoramic Balikpapan's bay and Makassar straits' view from the distance height, along with oil vessels, inter-insular ships, fishermen's boats and off-shore rigs really made my days to and fro in this historic yet clean n neatly arranged city of oil refinery. Pride of all these are always within and beyond. Thanks, (was Hotel Balikpapan is now) Novotel Balikpapan.",

Rooms were sufficiently spacious and the aircon was in good working order. \n\nThere is good management supervision at this hotel with the GM visiting guests at breakfast for feedback, as indeed was the case previously.\n\nI was disappointed by the poor restaurant at The Square restaurant in the hotel. Prawn bisque was cold and tasteless and my salmon main course over cooked and cold. It was not inexpensive. It had an adjacent bar with comfortable seating. I had little time to enjoy the hotels facilities. \n\nRooms were comfortable and I slept well. Wifi works well. \n\nIf your staying here and you need to eat - just slip out of the hotel turning left - down the hill to the sea front and there is an excellent selection of bars and restaurants less then ten minutes walk away and you can’t get lost.",

      "text": "I was lucky enough to be able to check in early at Swissbell hotel. However, despite requesting a room with a sea view, I was given a room with a view of an unsightly building. I have stayed at Swissbell numerous times before and have always enjoyed the sea views. On my latest trip, I decided to stay at Swissbell once again hoping for a sea view, but unfortunately, I did not get it. Consequently, my experience at Swissbell hotel was similar to staying at a 1-star hotel in the middle of the city.\n\nRegarding the room condition, I believe it's time for the hotel management to replace the carpet as it emits a musty smell. Additionally, the air conditioner was leaking, causing water to seep down to the floor in front of the bathroom's door. I decided to extend my stay for one more night, but the cleaning service failed to show up to clean my room on the second day. I had to call the reception twice to get my room cleaned.\n\nA 4-star hotel should demonstrate its quality through its service, ensuring customers have a pleasant stay.",

So I call housekeeping staff undername mas Alif to double check and he suggest me to changed the room. And I report it to reception, its ok because they upgrade my order to business executive (1602).\nBut the bathroom roof is leaky and I cant find any electric socket, there’s one socket on hairdryer holder but only for shavers. \nAnd It would be great if they have more furniture or room decoration in the living room.\nService was good and breakfast quite nice, there’s many various side dish and dessert but maincourse is so bad.

It has an upscale feel with many business visitors and also guests visiting for events at the hotel.  On my second visit I was given a room that unfortunately had a cigarette smell in the bathroom that was drifting into the room, and the front desk addressed the problem immediately by moving me to another room, no questions asked, which I thought was great service.

I always found pastry in every 4 star hotel breakfast buffet menu.\n\nFor room, I stayed in room 1221.

And a rather bad one at that. \nI am currently in their twin room.\nApart from the good size and the presence of a small kitchenette, there is nothing else good about the room. There are mosquitoes, a broken door leading to the pipe closet inside the room and very dirty walls and ceiling.\nThe pillows are of huge size, and when you ask them for thinner pillows they dont have any. \n\nLobbies are dirty. Dont get fooled by the well kept and pretty reception. Everything fails after that.\nI had booked myself at swiss belhotel and changed when I saw this on the way and now realise it was a big mistake",

      "text": "Had to stay here a couple of nights whilst on business. \n\nHotel looks good, with many facilities. I had a suite which was well equipped and spacious. However I felt that the hotel wasn’t as clean and maintained as it should be. There are a lot of loose boards in the boardwalk between the reception, rooms, pool area and beach. The pool water when seen at night was cloudy and looked dirty. \n\nFood was good, but a lot of the fried dishes seemed to be swimming in oil when served. The tables outside the restaurant really need deep cleaned as they all felt sticky. \n\nThe staff were really friendly and efficient, and this made my visit here. \n\nDespite my observations, I would still return here, as this would make a great stay if a few minor improvements made. \n",

I was tired after long journey but when I arrived i need to wait until the room is ready. (It states earliest check in is at 2pm but I can’t get my room key till 4pm) The reception isn’t friendly at all, because I asked many times when the room is ready, they started to ignore me and didn’t answer me. And it wasn’t that, the room is dirty, less lighting (some lamps didn’t work), a little water comes out from shower. This saddens me because i used to enjoy my stay at aston balikpapan, but for now i will find another hotel when I visit balikpapan again.",

Fortunately, they follow up the complain and fix the problem, although it was 10 PM. I stayed for 5 days. \nNext day I took dinner at the restaurant, and met Dinda, who in charged in teh restaurant. she is the best, very friendly, can recommended the food, I took dinner there everyday and served by her. And she is the only one I can found that smile and greet me. She is the best asset of the hotel.\nBreakfast to crowded, better to take early or late hour. The taste so standard, dinner's one still better.\nActually I believe this is supposed to be nice hotel, if it maintained properly and periodically. And this hotel is the best option, if you are looking big room, big sofa, dinner table, and with kitchen set.\nAston hotel also support B'Green, I took some photos for my B'Green collection\nHopefully Aston can fixed it and I will come back when it's better.",

      "text": "I realized that we stayed here during a very busy weekend, and therefore did expect some shortcomings, but this hotel just so so so lack maintenance. \n\nElevator\nOnly 1 guest elevator was working when we arrived and the overload sensor alarm went off when there were more than 5 people in the elevator (capacity said 1000kg and there was ample room for more people). Because the elevator can only carry so few at a time, the queue was horrible. Waited for almost an hour then decided to just take the emergency stairs to our rooms. Later in the evening the second elevator was usable but same case, overload sensor did not let more than 5 people on it. \n\nRoom and extra bed\nWe booked 1 executive and 2 superior rooms. Rooms are spacious and have great views but rather dirty and smells old. We paid for an extra bed, which turned out to be just a mattress without any kind of frame, just a mattress on the floor. When asked, the reply was extra bed standard is different in every hotel and this was how it is in Aston Balikpapan. Tried to reconfirm it at check out, yes that was indeed the standard extra bed. \n\nI mentioned earlier we understand it was a busy weekend. I am not going to nitpick at other services that i’m sure they deliver better under normal circumstances. But overall it was a very unpleasant stay\n",

First i had a problem when i checked in, the receptionist said the room wasnt ready while it was actually 11 PM, which is far from the check in time agreement. Apart from that, on my first day my room wasnt cleaned well, because the floor was still full of dust and hair and smells bad. The foods were mostly okay and the chef was nice, but I found larva in my juice and and insects in my mineral water. I also had a problem when i had my meeting because the banquet team wasnt present near my meeting room, so my event became a little bit late because i had a problem with my microphone and projector. I also needed to go out of my meeting room and searched for the banquet team for almost half an hour. I am seriously not recommending this hotel if you want to stay in Balikpapan. WORST HOTEL EVER AND THE SERVICE IS LIKE 2 STARS HOTEL INSTEAD OF 4.",

      "text": "The photos say it all - not sure how this hotel is able to survive with all the myriad of problems it has. Where do I begin - water faucets in shower that falls off ; leaky ceiling; mould  all over the bathrooms ; stains on walls and itchy sofa; rooms that smell of smoke ; threadbare towels ; terrible service that leaves only one towel in a 2-bedroom apartment with 3 occupants.\n\nThe icing on the cake - nail in my morning breakfast pancake. Thought it was a piece of clove but turned out to be a rusty piece of tiny nail, which with a faster eater would have ended up tearing a gash in one’s oesophagus. Or living in your stomach causing untold problems. \n\nOh, did I mention the aircon are super noisy and the water dispenser, really dirty ? The source of water in the dispenser is suspect so suggest you get your own water outside of the hotel. \n\nNeedless to say this has been my worst hotel stay ever. Please for your own health stay elsewhere.",

      "text": "Stay here for one night only with family (2 adults and 2 kids), we were expecting that this hotel is still in good shape and performance, but you can't expect too much. \n\nThe security guard was very attentive to helping our bags. The lobby is quite spacious with wooden ornament, and the Receptionist looks fresh but very quiet. No small talk, just asking about the reservation and disclaimer, fine for smoking in a non-smoking room, fine if the keycard is lost, etc. \n\nI only get 1 key, going up to the room (connecting room), and voila! The room is narrow and looks poor. The sheer curtain has torn, and I took the picture as proof to show them it was torn the first time, not because of my toddlers. \nConnecting door latch looks like a public toilet kind of latch. How come, the 4-star hotel uses this latch model in their connecting doors???\n \nThen I asked for one more key, they give me the bad condition one, it's not supposed to give to the guest anymore. It has split in two but they held it together with cello tape. It crossed my mind to just throw it on purpose because the key is really not suitable for guests.\n\nThe bathroom is narrow, and the bath towels are very poor! So many stains on it. The only way you can differ between the bath towels and the bathmat is the size.\n\nView from the room is a half-plane runway and half zinc roof, very unattractive. TV channels are not clean, unenjoyable bed, the carpet needs to replace, please. It's all worn. \nMy best comment would be to the AC, hotels cold! \n\nThe breakfast experience was not very memorable. No greeter who usually asked for your room number, Resto was spacious but looked empty. The food stall was so-so, but the waffle was tasty! \nThey only served one egg for one portion of sunny-side-up (two eggs usually in other hotels).\nThe Staff was just busy doing their stuff, no communication with the guests, no offers, no chit-chat, making my husband and I wondered 'this restaurant might have just been hit by a zombie attack?'. Very quiet. No cheerful or friendly atmosphere. \n\nThe swimming pool is nice and shady with plants and trees surrounding, fit for you and your kids during afternoon or morning swim. \n\nThis hotel is just 6 years old but very disappointed. The Hotel Management really needs to do recovery.",

For example, the dimmer curtains were not able to be pulled tightly closed and daylight came through which interrupted sleep. The curtain railings were jammed and told the front desk about it, but no one came to address the problem.\n\nThe linen sheets smelled funky. I had to give it a few sprays of cologne to hide the smell.  The bathroom shampoo dispenser was nearly empty and noone came to top up. The toilet bowl was icky. Had stains in it, it didnt appeared to be cleaned properly.  \n\nQuarantine meals were a big let down. The portions were very small. I would say kid-sized meals which hardly was enough for an adult. Very likely you will need to supplement by delivery orders.  \n\nInternet was another letdown. The Internet in the room was unstable and lagged a lot. So, video calls over WhatsApp or such were of poor quality. The hotel really needs to sort this out.  After all this, It would seem giving it a 3 star out of 5 appears generous. I only gave it 3 stars because i had to endure only 3 nights stay. If it was longer...",

I initially booked for a superior room, but a very kind young man named Pebry kindly assisted us for a more wonderful staying experience in this hotel.\nI found the room was nice, although it is lack of the promised facilities (mini refrogerator and minibar). Another minor disturbance is a non-functioning power plug near a bed, where it seems that have been blocked by something. But that's not a major issue\n\nSome tips prior to staying here:\n-If you are landing in Sepinggan Airport and want to head directly to the hotel, don't forget to call the reception for a free airport transfer. It's a great deal, as it will save you from 70k rupiah of 5 min taxi trip. You can also order a free airport transfer going from hotel to the airport\n-You're going to be asked for 100k rupiah for a deposit for your key card. Don't forget to ask for a refund upon checking out",

IT is very close to the hotel, only about 800m and can be reached very easy.\nEven though it is so close, you can sleep in the rooms very good without noise.\nThe receiption was very friendly and follow every inquiry and help in any case. We had some problem with the safe because we made a mistake but immy. the person in charge came to the room to fix the problem. Very excellent service.\nThe restaurant had national and international food and also the breakfast was very good.\nTo stay for 1 or 2 days, the hotel is more than perfect for a transfer if flight will arrive at night and next flight on the next day. \nIf we do another trip to Indonasia, we would always take this hotel again.",

      "text": "Great hotel for avgeek and planespotters! The location is near with Balikpapan Sepinggan Airport and has an awesome view of the mentioned airport runway and also with sea-view too. You can take both planes and ships photos.\n\nFor taking airplane photos, at least 55mm lens is required. But it's more recommended to use lens focal length more than 100mm depending on how far and how big the aircraft (Twin Otter or another small propeller aircraft photo need at least >200mm focal length). Turn off your air conditioner or set it at ~24°C if you want to take photos from windows, because the windows could become hazy if your room temperature too low and it takes quite time for the haze to disappear!\n\nPlease note that you should ask hotel receptionist to reserve you a room with Runway view, which i recommends you to take room on 4th floor since it's the highest floor available. You should try contact them directly via phone some days before your stay, and follow up your special request two and one day before your stay.\n\nNormally the hotel started check-in time at 2pm, but if your desired room is available you can check-in early starting at 10am without any additional charge. For late check-out there is a charge that costs 25% from basic rate until 2/3pm if i'm not mistaken. \n\nAlso, they offer free airport pick-up and drop-off service. For pick-up service, you should contact them in advance directly via phone at least one day before your stay.\n\nThe bad thing is : \n- Wi-Fi connection is unforgivably slow, especially for 4-stars hotel standard. I have been staying on several much cheaper backpacker hostels both in Indonesia and abroad, and they have much better internet connection. Try using your phone tethering feature since internet connection from your mobile provider may more reliable than the hotel's Wi-Fi.\n- Please note that there is a minimum IDR 100.000,- refundable deposit required if you're paying using cash.\n- Maybe just my taste but in my opinion, the breakfast menu taste is quite plain. The good thing is there are a lot of options for your breakfast in this hotel.",

Food was disappointment steak was relatively ok but potatoes were cold, it also surprised me that restaurant does not serve beer. Also no pre information that massage service was stopped until 15.6. due to Ramadan. Over all I would not recommend this hotel for especially for our company oversea visitors, only 4 star level in here is laundry price. If you need to sleep near by airport this good location but there also other options which I would recommend to try. Tommi room 112",

We ordered Sop Buntut and Fried Rice. It was nice, not that perfect as its not that hot when served but the taste is good.\nThe breakfast service was great too. They had various types of food from Indonesian to western.\nThe best was the hospitality of the staffs. \nFrom check in counter service, restaurant service, and even one of the staffs, ms Tasya was so helpful and kindly prepared my special request to give birthday surprise for my husband.\nOverall, today was one of my best moments staying at Hotels in Balikpapan, especially with Platinum Hotel.\nThank you",

It was not available on My trip)\nSmall notes on the swimming pool,  found used mask leaved on the swimming pool chair / table (quite annoying) - there was no crew on duty (twice visit the swimming pool).\n\nOverall, it was a great stay in this hotel.

Quite clean and tidy. Unfortunately, when I stayed there I found out that the free mineral water were already opened. It seems that when the housekeeping clean up the room, they forgot to replace it with the new one. \nA little bit mess at the bathroom, since the shower area have almost the same level as the closet and sink, so it will leave a mess after we're taking a shower. Maybe they can put a little bit more barrier so water from the shower will not run to the other area. \nStaffs : The staffs were great! From the security guard, front desk, and all the attendants were helpful, friendly, and warm. \nBreakfast : Very basic. Need more variety. But the service was helpful and great!",

I've seen better but compare to what I have experienced, this hotel is definitely worth your budget and yet give you some advantages. \n\nlets start from some plus point experienced from my stay :fantastic location!!! close to the airport and shopping centers. I stayed in the 6th floor and I feel pleased with my room,even it wasnt big enough like what I expected but it is nice and comfy too (so Thumbs up for this), The aircon is great and working nicely, the waters running so well both hot and cold, the Front staffs were great in during my check in and check out, they help me in suggesing places to buy some souvenirs and where to go during my short stay.\n\nthe Cons : the restaurant was an empty meeting room which function as moving restaurant (I think so), breakfast did not have many choices and to be honest was little bland. The Wifi connection was okay, both of breakfast service and wifi were just okay and i have experienced better on the other same budget or class.\n\ndespite the cons I mentioned, this hotel is surely recommend! I highly want to stay again in this hotel again if i have to come to Balikpapan again. keep up the good work WhizPrime.",

Looks like they rarely make up less used bed. I have no idea for how many years the bed isn't been touch. All i know the next morning i woke up with red rashes all over my back and neck.\nAnd it's true the key system doesn't work.

Now I am not sure how it works but I had the excess refunded the next morning without asking for it which was nice. The room is clean and tidy and smelled fresh. The bathroom layout is a little unusual but perfectly functional and again very clean. Towels were adequate and bedding clean. \nI didn't think much of the breakfast but then I can say the same for every budget hotel in this neck of the woods so toast and jam is probably what you'll end up with and there's plenty of that. So all told, a quiet night, low cost and much nicer than some of the older damp places around.",

The bathroom still ok, hot water, shower, and amenities. Spa facilities and bar restaurant lounge available. Awesome breakfast with various delicious menu.

      "text": "We stopped by for a night in this hotel and booked a Grand Deluxe Room at level 3. Our room located in the front side of the building facing the street and the ocean. It was a luxurious room, very clean, and perfect. Wide bathroom equipped with bathub, hair drier, and full packed toiletteries including shaving kit which rarely find in another hotel. We ordered Kwetiau and Spicy Tofu for dinner, the service was quick, but I don't think it was fresh meal. And the Kwetiau just tasted like Fettucini with oriental touch. \n\nThe nxt morning, we went down for breakfast at 7.30 am and the restaurant was full, only three tables left and were at smoking area. I think you need more space and tables for the restaurant.  Wide variation of menu, fresh salad, porridge, and local cuisines. I tried Lontong Sayur and again, tasted like it has been cooked for a week 😂😂. You guys really need an improvement for food. \n\nSo, 5 stars for room and hospitality, 2.5 stars for food.",

It's just that, due to technical problems, the no smoking room should be the opposite. Air freshener doesn't help much. The atmosphere improved slightly after the room was given a coffee-flavored air freshener. Finally, all assignments at balikpapan can be successfully completed.",

      "text": "This hotel seems older than the others since it had built when my parents haven't met each other but, I still think that this is one of the best choices for you guys to stay in Balikpapan. My experience staying in this hotel was quite fun since as you enter the lobby it seems so spacious and quiet even though the lobby is directly connected to the bar. The room of this hotel is really cozy and the room service is polite because they always smile and greet as we see each other and they also helped me carry luggage when I was already at the bar. I can do many kinds of sports here which is swimming and also, they have a gym. The last thing that I want to recommend is the restaurant which is the Skybar. There are plenty varieties of food which is available here and the best of this bar is the location which is a few levels above the bar and it is outdoor.",

They brought my bags up to the room and i knew i was at the place to be in Balikpapan.  \n\nroom was, bright, CLEAN AND NICE !!\n\nThe room has good wifi and for me after coming from a place with no ac, and no hot water it was like being in heaven 😁😁👍.\n\ni was leaving the room when my ipad pinged with a message so i stopped outside the door to check it when 2 polite young ladies from staff were walking by a d asked if everything was ok.  i told them just checking messages and they said if i needed anything to please let them know.\n\nthat was a first !  added to my great first impressions.\n\ni decided to go have a beer in the lounge.\n\nagain like a movie set from years ago in the time when hotels like this were for the rich, famous or important people.\n\nanother reviewer mentioned the hotel is old, which it is but the difference between this hotel and another hotel here is THIS PLACE IS CARED FOR AND IT SHOWS !\n\nOrdered a beer and since i was only person there i chatted with the Bartender Miss Feby.  very polite sweet young lady and another young man also.  was showing them some photos of my travels and home and next thing i knew it was like i was holding court.  many of staff and gathered around and i was surrounded by new friends.\n\nsome other guest had come and sat in the lounge and the waiter stopped talking and went right over to them and when Miss Feby got the order she aslo stopped talking and made the order.  Just as it should be.\n\nthen another young lady walked out and started talking and introduced here self as from food and beverage sales.\nMiss Marzsa Noer Larasati.  \n\nas much as i hated to leave she brought me up and showed me \nthe skybar.  i had no idea it existed.  we talked anout many\n things and you could see in the way she carried herself and spoke she was a professional in her job.\n\nshe promotes events for the hotel and she gave me her business card and explained her job.  she makes sure everything in restaurant and bars is perfect for the guest.\n\nthey have many different events and she shared her whatsapp with me and the phots show this is not just a nice hotel but a fun place to be for all ages in Balikpapan. \n\nsadly i had a dinner engagement out with friends a d had to excuse myself.  very hard to leave this young lady.  her attitude about her job and life was amazing.  she will have not just a great career but great life also.\nthe next morning I had a 6:45 AM flight and my ride was supposed to pick me up at 4:30 but never showed and the guy who ran my tour was constantly checking with me to see if his driver arrived and i was pacing back and forth and the staff asked if i needed help and when i explained my predicament they got their phones out and got me a grab car to airport a d when it arrived they grabbed my bags and put them in the car for me.  \n\nthanks guys for your help.  made flight thanks to you !\n\ni urge all of you to talk with the staff when you go to different places.  everyone has a story to tell and is happy to share it all around the world.  you learn thing not only about the place you are staying but places in towns you do not know about as well as making new friends and to me thats why i always enjoy meeting people.",

      "text": "I have been all around the area and found this the best place to stay. It proved to be a great base for everything I needed and wanted to do in Balikpapan and around it. I liked that it is strategically perched on the hill overlooking the city and the strait, and that it is at the crossroads with easy access to the sights in all the directions. In my opinion, those hotels nearby, even the newer ones, are not as spacious and definitely not as charming as this classy and stylish Gran Senyiur. I was impressed with hotel's amenities and facilities that any business or tourism traveler may need. The WiFi worked great in the room and everywhere around the hotel. Everything is very accessible and comfortable: the gym, the pool, the spa, the restaurants, the bars. The breakfast is diverse and delicious, just wish I left more space for the yummy local deserts served there. I had some lunches and other meals at the hotel and they were memorably tasty. No real surprise, but everyone, from the front desk to the manager, was genuinely welcoming and helpful. There are nice seafood restraints nearby, by the shoreline, but I am happy I went to the nightly gig at the hotel by LasMorado band, the four super-talented and friendly musicians, in the Sky Bar upstairs, which is also a great place to catch a fantastically refreshing breeze and enjoy breathtaking views, with a choice of drink and food. Thank you Gran Senyiur. I will plan to stay here again on my next visit to East Kalimantan.",

Room was big enough for an extra bed. Fridge was cold n was able to make ice cubes. Great! \nBreakfast was good. \nStaff were all very friendly n helpful n polite. \nLocation was just right. Near to many restaurants. \nLuckily there were enough lifts . So did not have to wait long to go back to our room. \nWe went to Samarinda hoping to visit the Dayak village. Unfortunately they were in mourning as one of them just died. \nFor Dayak ceremony are held on Sunday morning only.",

As well upreviously mentioned the rooms are large and the hotel looks fantastic but age is catching up with the hotel. The en-suite was good but the shower was slow to drain, the bed was firm but good, the AC worked well in the room and the sheets and towels were clean and replaced as required. I found the internet wifi slow and very intermittent which might sound trivial but is so important these days! Overall I enjoyed my stay and found the staff wonderful and welcoming! Terima kasih!!",

But as you scratch the surface, like the exterior of the building itself it’s all false and showing it’s age - that can’t be forgiven because it is really old.\n\nRooms are a fair size & well stocked for amenities, but that’s what you’d expect for a 5*- carpets are tired, bathroom has had more holes drilled & filled then tiles should. Sealant is discolored and moldy. \n\nBreakfast was a fair selection of International & Ethnic - but not vast.\n\nRestaurant carried the same air of aging as the rooms.\n\nI didn’t see any other 4*/5* to compare it with to say if it’s better than other choices. It’s functional, safe, basically clean with a feeling of old colonial. \n\nDon’t expect much more.\n\n",

No coordination between the Sales and the Operation Team. Lack of responds from the S&M Director who is assigned as our account / event handler.\n\nThe Room is quite spacious, but in the hallway we can smell smoke odor while we were staying in a non smoking room / floor.\n\nFor the group, the reception need to be more detailed. My guest were charged, while they weren't supposed to be charge because i have paid full for his stay. And other guests that is on personal account does not get charged for their usage in room.",

I was told it is the most luxurious hotel in town. The meeting room was spacious, although the service boy was not very fast in response to technical problem. The breakfast is good, but for 5 stars hotel it is a bit overrated. The swimming pool opens at 7am and closes at 6pm. So basically if you have full-day meeting, you can't swim.

I have to raise my voice a bit before the lady finally allow me to check the bill. My suspicion was correct the room charge is mistaken. Funny things is the staff cannot rectify the bill, and I chose not to sign something that is incorrect. They said that I have to wait for their Manager who is coming to the hotel around 9 a.m, I am not going to do it as I have a plane to board. They did promise me to send me a copy of my bill to my email which they did with poor quality images. Almost nothing can be seen from the pictures.\n\nIsn't the hotel suppose to have an Manager On Duty to handle this sort of stuff? and come on what so called Managers...please arrive a bit early.\n\nI regret to let you know Mr. General Manager...that was the last time I stayed in your hotel and will be my last. I will never stay there anymore let alone recommend this hotel to my guests who are visiting Balikpapan. \n\nGreat location + Poor services = Lose Customers!",

      "text": "Staying for less than 24 hours in Balikpapan, I choose this hotel mainly because of the location directly opposite Balikpapan Trade Center (BTC) or also known as Balikpapan Plaza. The excellent location helps you to do your shopping and back to the hotel for little bit of rest and then continue again. It gives you the whole new meaning to Shop till you drop or shop till you broke :-)\n\nAnyway, despite the excellent location I have to agree with some other reviewer that this hotel need to be refurbished again. Staying in their Deluxe room on the fifth floor provide me with less noise from the night club. LCD TV and Separate Air Conditioner system run perfectly to keep you comfort. \n\nBreakfast as usual is Okay, nothing special but perhaps the restaurant attendance need to keep an eye of the amount of food. When I am doing my breakfast, the food is finished and took a while for someone to replenish the empty serving dish. \n\nThe bellboy and the housekeeping is ready at time notice to help you with the luggage.\n\nOverall, with such a short time in town I have nothing much to complain about. Definitely an alternative hotel especially if you want to hang around BTC area.",

      "text": "On the way back from Bontang we stayed here for one night & it was not a very good experience.  The place needs an overhaul.  The room I was given (609) took almost full night to cool down.  Breakfast spread was so-so & the work table was heavily infested with ants which went in my laptop & kept on coming out at any time. The good point about this place is it is very close to a mall, shopping & dining area.  Parking is limited & reception area is with high ceiling.  I knew this place since 1995 but stayed here for the 1st time & it will be also last time unless I get some positive comments from visitors who stay here from now onwards.",

Ex-\n\nVery poor accomodation for the business traveler who works from the room a lot.\n\n      Only ether cable hook up so you must sit an uncomfortable side chair to be online.\n      Very awkward, uncomfortable work area for computer\n\nOther than changing the sheets and wiping down the bathroom floor the room really doesnt get cleaned.\n     No rug vaccuuming\n     No dusting or wiping down of walls. IN my room someone smashed a bloody mosquito    against a wall leaving a nasty smear. It was never touched by the cleaning crew,\n\nTHe restaurant is passable. I ate meals here quite a bit as the only other choices were fast food. SOme dishes were surprising good- even to a western palatte. They do a breakfast buffet that to me was pretty nasty, but that may be a cultural thing. I ate omelets every day. They have cereal containers- they just dont put cereal in them.\n\nThe power goes off continually. 6-8 times a day. Usually only for a few seconds.\n\nThe staff is really good here. English is strong and they really try to make you comfortable. The service will remind you of a much higher quality hotel. THe nice people who work here made this a much more pleasant experience than it might otherwise have been.",

      "text": "Balik Papan was a fascinating provincial capital. It was clean, well maintained and orderly. \n\nThe Hotel was centrally located and well suited for the business traveler. The lobby area is spacious with high ceiling. In November the air in Balik Papan was rather still and humid. Arriving in mid afternoon, the lobby area was too warm for comfort. Luckily checking in was a breeze.\n\nThe room was rather run-down. I was quite happy with the bedding but the bathroom was a disappointment. Hoteliers should be experienced enough to replace worn down towels. The view from the hotel room was not fascinating although sea facing.\n\nBreakfast at the cafe was just average. As with many hotels MSG was noticeable in almost all dishes. Beverages were served at the lobby lounge. Entertainment was provided by a four piece band. The presence of overly friendly ladies trying to catch your attentions was noticeable and the Hotel did not seem to have the desire to control. Service was average. \n\nIf you were game for Nasi Padang, there were many outlets. Starbucks and KFC were also within walking distance. We had the best fried duck rice while in Balik Papan. Ask the concierge for direction.\n\nInternet connection was available in the lounge area. \n\nBalikpapan is a growing city and there are many new hotels some of which have better facilities and more lively. This hotel is an average, tired hotel in need of a makeover and a dose of adrenalin.",

The only thing was the disturbance of prayer at daybreak (actually 4 am) but the hotel cannot do much about it. I actually asked to be moved to the other side (seaview) and they gave me another room. Wonderful open-air swimming pool. the real drawback was actually the food served at lunch and dinner. Breakfast was fine, but the oher meals were quite a disappointment, probably because I am not used to this kind of food (being French). Yet, evrybody else (the locals) seemed to enjoy it... Lots of restaurants, fabulous seafood, by the seaside, 10 mn from the hotel. Wonderful service.",

      "text": "I find this hotel in a very strategic & convinient location since the biggest mal in Balikpapan (which is Balikpapan Plaza) is literally in front of this hotel. For me, I always put location as my number 1 criteria in finding hotels since I'm a female soli traveler and I only stay in Balikpapan just for one night in order my transit to Derawan Island the day after. I don't need to explore the city, I just want to find a decent meal nearby with cheap price & shop for small groceries for my next trip to Derawan. I can say that I've found anything I need in this plaza. So that I can't feel more happier finding this very strategic hotel with its location.\nThe cons of this hotel is the old building, old room, old furniture & old bathroom. But it's just alright & still decent for a night stay.\nOne thing that really dissapointment is that they actually DON'T provide airport shuttle for every hour but only for 12 am shuttle! I asked about that shuttle since I've read the previous review under me saying that there is an airport shuttle service every hour so that I expect to have that kind of service as well. But when the receptionist asked when is my flight and I answered that it will be on 12.20 am, she said that I won't make it to the airport with the 12 am-shuttle. When I asked is there a shuttle for 11 am, she answered that there IS ONLY ONE shuttler per day, which is departing on 12 am only. How ridiculous is that?\nI don't know maybe the receptionist has demeaning me for being a young woman who usually don't really like to argue or debate. \nSo that in order to save my money for 50,000 rupiahs taxi fare to the airport (which actually I don't necesarrily spend for), I had to buy a KFC's cheapest package that only costs 15,000 rupiahs for my lunch (&dinner as well!). Sigh.,,,",

Other similar class hotel will cost ~US$50 - 55.\n- Complimentary airport shuttle, depart every hour or so from the hotel\n- Staff is helpful and friendly, service is OK, 8 out of 10.\n- Room is quite big.\n- Bed is averagely standard, not too good, not too bad.\n- Nearby money changer, restaurant, etc.\n- Mass transport is easily found (angkutan umum/taxi).\n- Standard toilet amenities (soap, shampoo, etc, but no toothbrush and toothpaste)\n\nCons :\n- Hotel is aging, interior etc is getting old.\n- Swimming pool wasn't really at the hotel, but located on the other newer \"Menara Bahtera\" hotel, at the back of \"Adika Bahtera\" hotel, both hotel are owned by the same owner.\n- If the windows in your room are facing street, you may hear sound from outside.\n- No carpet on room, just floor tile (room type : Superior, other upper room type may have, not sure about it.)\n- AC isn't working good, even you put it to max cold (but not sure if other rooms have the same problem, could be in my room only. Last stay was in 6th floor.)\n- No WiFi on room, just LAN access (excl. room price)",

There's also a local coffee shop just accros the hotel that many locals would recommend.\nA few things need improvement were: couches & chairs in fabric material weren't cleaned properly, dining area for smoking people was more spacious than the non-smoking one, and they seem to allow guests to smoke in their huge lobby area.",

We had standard room with twin beds, space was more than adequate. Bathroom was in good condition and functioning properly. AC and TV channel was good also. Hotel management should pay attention on room cleanliness. It appeared that the room, bed and linen were not thouroughly cleaned up. Swimming pool and lobby also looked aging.",

The view is so good & breathtaking, a city view + beach + sea + hills. You're also able to see the live performance of local musicians in lobby at night, it's free.

Gym is forlorn, only open half of the time and with broken air con. Swimming pool area is equally sad and the seafood restaurant permanently closed.

      "text": "Stayed here out of curiosity. It has it's own private beach in the middle of the city. Well other review nailed it right. This hotel are quite old. Some 23 years. Its furniture are in need of renovation. The facilities too. Even the hotel ground doesn't seem to be well maintained. The beach are too close to local fishermen village. And also need some kind of development. In short this hotel need massive renovation.\nOn Services though despite seemingly lack antusiasm on guest request.Both visual and verbal, Flat face (except for the security that greet you at the entrance) and flat conversation are everywhere.  surprisingly they got their job done. They need to improve this.\nIm not sure about the policy, but it does seems they put their guess in a smoking room first unless you complaint(?). Since we came not too late. However all 3 guest that check in a the same time with us came with a notification all non smoking room were full. Only minutes later upon protest that they placed us on a non smoking one. A let down.\nNot much selection on breakfast but the quality are surprisingly good.",

The soap is even of low quality as a cost saving exercise. smell pack with cheap perfume. The room service food is sloppy and doesnt deserve a second chance. Fish and chips are oil soaked and with cheap frozen fish squares. Because they now have different clientele, the breakfast has no western selection except eggs. dont bother about western breakfast, with 100s of people rushing to the food queue. I have not been here for a long time,  and shall not be caught here anymore. Just for the record, room 325 on 6 April. Western expat should avoid this hotel if you are looking for a good rest before a meeting.",

And the hotel has never understood the concept of hygiene.  For example, small flies on the food, blackened water dispenser faucets, and cockroaches in the bathroom. (Please see the photos I uploaded.)\n\n<1> For 5 days, every time I had breakfast, I found small flies stuck to the top of the fruit juice jar, on the pudding, and on the pieces of fruit. I had reported to the restaurant staff 2 times, but the next morning there were still flies. They never improved the situations and never apologized to me. Never said any kind of \"sorry\".(Please see the photos I uploaded.). \n\n<2> Ibis Balikpapan does not provide mineral water in plastic bottles, but they do provide water dispensers in the corridors. The problem is, the dispensers that line up are not kept clean so that the water dispenser faucets have turned black. I'd checked all the dispensers that were on the floor I was staying at. I also asked housekeeping staff to clean it up, but until the day I checked out it had not been cleaned.(Please see the photos I uploaded.)\n\n<3> Everyday, without exception, I found small cockroaches, measuring 3-4mm, in the bathroom. (Please see the photos I uploaded.)",

Hot water works shower super good and spacious enough for me. Everything works. I went there by motorbike. Parking super easy and quite safe. Ibis doesn’t have swimming pool but we can use Novotel’s swimming pool. Which is awesome.  Aircon is good. Sheets and towels are clean. \nLocation location location! I love it! Prime location i tell you.\n\nCons\nIt was my birthday during the stay, and looking at other people review being celebrated by a surprise cake i kinda hoped i get the same treatment. But no one came to me. So sad. It was my solo trip.\nI also noticed there were no hospitality spirit among the staff at the Front Office. It’s like they have lost the spark. Idk what happened but i think you should fix that soon. They seemed not happy. Except for my favorite chubby male staff of housekeeping. He still got that hospitality vibe  when facing a guest. I can feel good vibes from him. \n\nOverall it was a pleasant stay. I’ll be back for sure!\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year!",

For the price we found it good value - especially as we were able to use the swimming pool at the Novatel next door!\nA buffet breakfast was included, with a good range of hot local and western food, and including cereals, pastries and toast.\nWe stayed in a different room each time - one had dodgy airconditioning, but generally they were acceptable and the beds were comfortable. Housekeeping were great - bought us extra towels and anything else we requested.\nThe location was good - a short walk to the main road and seafront, and to a big shopping centre and mosque.",

Then when I entered my smoking room didn't smell at all.  The VIP amenities was very beautiful. The room was like any other Ibis.\nOne thing that really impressed me was the staffs response to my requests. They were very polite, helpful and quick. Like when I borrowed sarong and praying mat just came less than 10 minutes delivered by Jumadi. The room service was also good. I like the taste and presentation of oxtail soup. The waiter who delivered my order was also polite. The first night waiter was Rai and for the second night was Hendra who delivered my room service.\nWhen I had breakfast the waitress, Cyintia and Tjandra her supervisor also helpful since finding me seat and asked what I want to have. They also helped me chose Ayam Singkawang for my lunch. It was so delicious. They said that was Kalimantan's original taste I had to try.\nThat girl who was in charge as duty manager that evening, Novita was also very polite. She came to me said hi and offered if I wanted to try food stall outside near drop off area. It was like a traditional stall also cheap but delicious. \nThen finally when I asked for transportation to airport and assistance with my plane ticket Dewi and Zulfa helped me. They came with official issue boarding pass. Maybe because the airline office was in the same building.\nFeels like five star service from three star hotel.\nOne thing that they need to improve was the internet connection's speed. It was not fast enough like I need. The rest was very good.",

No door staff, just the three standing at the front desk. \nNo real distinction between the front desk and the bar/restaurant as they seem to merge into one. At least one person on the front desk knew what was happening. Standing for over 35 minutes checking in almost got me overcome by cigarette smoke. While the smokers were outside, the doors were left open so they could talk to their colleagues inside. Smoked out.\nThe rooms are ok. Small and the bathrooms are poky but it is an Ibis so I’m not expecting a Hilton. \nVery tempted to cut my stay short and move next door to the Novotel.\nWill not be a return visitor...better options by far just next door.",

      "text": "Firstly, it took me about 30 minutes just to check in into the hotel. There were two receptionist at the counter. While the first receptionist was attending to another guest, the other one didnt seem to care about my existence, probably assuming i was together with the other guest. \n\nRoom was small but it was enough for me. Toilet was smelly and unclean.\n\nI requested for iron after i checked in and was told that they ran out of iron and will try to get from another guest and deliver it to my room. Didnt receive any update from them so I went again to the receptionist and was told that there is no iron available for me. So had to go for my first day of the business conference with wrinkle shirt (luckily i wear jacket).\n\nDuring the business conference, I had a chat with a fellow attendee staying at novotel. He updated that novotel had the same iron shortage but the hotel offered him free iron service for his shirt and trouser. Same service should be offered at ibis.",

And for the football lovers, i really recommended to stay at this hotel because it has midtown coffee as one of official hotel for world cup program. U may seen the world cup match with the economist beverage  package offering. And for selfie lovers, this hotel has many spot to be taken, such as at the restaurant and it really instagramable. Beside, the hotel really near to the mall, so my kiddos can spend their days out there..\nSo, overall .. it feels like home. While i stay faraway from family during ied day.. Seems like all staff so friendly and nice also helpful. The fo staff help me with the xpress check in, and it has wide parking car area. The food was good, and the houskeeping staff really helpfull while im asking them to make up my room.\nWill be come back again, there..",

Air shower kamar mandi gak stabil, kadang airnya deras kadang kecil banget sampe mau bilas jadi lama banget. Staf ramah, tapi beberapa kali house keeping gak bersihin kamar kecuali saya telpon, dan kamar baru dibersihkan seringnya udah sore banget sekitar jam 4 bahkan lebih. Pas saya telpon ke bagian house keeping, stafnya malah nanya \"Ibu tidak request dibersihkan?\", lah memangnya setiap hari saya harus request dulu?? Saya menginap 4 malam disini, di hari pertama dan kedua dibersihkan, tapi berikutnya harus saya yg aktif minta. Selain itu pengalaman menginap di hotel lain, yg namanya kamar dibersihkan itu udah mandatory, kecuali tamunya yg gak mau. Kadang setelah pulang kerja sampai kamar, kamar masih belum dibersihkan. Kelebihannya dekat dengan E walk mall dan pentacity.\nOhya sarapan juga biasa aja. Karena kurang suka dgn hospitality-nya saya akhirnya pindah hotel.",

The hotel is located in downtown so it pretty easier to find food during the night, especially because the inside resto open only until 10PM. Order dinner thru room service is the best choice, if you are too lazy to go out. The breakfast is OK.",

      "text": "Pro's : this is a brand new hotel, affordable price, clean environment, cozy room, very clean, bathroom is pretty small but who needs too spacey bathroom, right? hot water is stable, 3 in 1 body shampoo is nicely fragrant and feels smooth on hair. They also have rooftop pools and bar. I didnt try it out cos it was rain.\n\nCon's : this is a nice hotel but, their staffs needs to learn more attitudes. Staffs at restaurant, at coffee station just sit and keep looking at her cellphone which was not appropriate at all. no smile, no sweet talk... only one restaurant staff who was very responsive and friendly. A fat tall guy, i didnt ask for his name. I accompanied my husband to have sahur @4 am, he was helping us. and again at morning when I took my toddler having breakfast, again he was serving the guests. oh and the cleaning service guy wiped the window in front of us @9 am while we're having breakfast. seriously?\n\nBreakfast and meal : standard.",

Maxone was the one and only pet friendly hotel in Balikpapan which we could stay with our cats. Extremely helpful staff very clean rooms and great service. We would recommend Maxone to anyone who travels with their cats. \n\nKeep up the great work. Thank you very much for your hospitality.\n\nBest wishes from Tarkan and Kathrin",

      "text": "To be fair, I put this up front: I didn't get to stay here, well, I choose not to (for now), to be exact. With that in mind, let's continue. I believe, this hotel has a nice room, great arrangement. Love how the children space accommodate adults, with outdoor setting near the lobby, so smoker parents can still smoke, read newspaper, sipping coffee, and can be close to their children. The pool is great, outdoor and on high floor. So you can enjoy the city view from above. The bar is just next to it. The spa is on the same floor. Like I said earlier, I didn't spend the night here, so I don't know how the room setting, the bathroom, the amenities, but I'm sure it's great. Hell, maybe even the breakfast taste delicious. OK, here's why. As I walked up to the receptionist, no smile, no welcome, no good afternoon, no what can I do for you. No, none of that happened. Maybe she was busy, maybe she was having a hard time, but hell, this is hospitality industry, and you're working in one. At least a fake smile will do, which by the way, i didn't get either. With a front line like that, I didn't want to know how the others like. Especially when I want to bring my parents, friends, and family for a long weekend stay there. Maybe, I'll try it for myself first, and not now, not in the near future. Who knows, maybe then I'll change my rating too.",

      "text": "This is expensive but the quality is high and the money goes to an  inspiring cause. I recommend watching Willie Smitt Ted Talk. He is the founder and it gives an overview of the vast project of Samboja Lestari. \nAlthough it is known for Orangutan and Sunbear rehabilitation, it's the work on replanting decimated forests that is most inspiring. An example of vision, imagination and hope against all odds.\n\nThe lodge is designed to high quality using architecture and materials of local Dayak . You eat dinner to the sounds of the rainforest plus orangutans bellowing in the background. You learn all about the Orangutans and sun bears, mainly rescued from people keeping them as pets or in the entertainment industry. The efforts to rehabilitate them (sometimes not possible). Our guide had an inspiring story of quitting is well paid job in the mining industry when he realised the damage it was doing and taking a much  less well paid job so that he could work towards a better future for his daughter. There was some information about the reforestation but the Willie Smitt Ted talk gives a much better overview of just what a challenge they took on, with planet and people front of mind and the incredible impact they've already had in just 20 years.   \nThe food is excellent some of the best we've had in Indonesia. They catered well for vegetarians which we were very grateful for. We looked forward to each meal.   \nService was excellent. Staff spoke good English and we're friendly and attentive which made things easy. \nBear in mind there are costs for meals and there are no other places to eat. 250,000 rupiah per meal per person. Breakfast is included in the room rate.  \n\nThey offer pick up and drop off from where you need. It's 500,000 rupiah each way. Top tip -  if you organise pick up - make sure you specify exactly where to meet the driver or ask them to give you a description of the car that will pick you up so you can find them. We arranged to be picked up at the bus station but the driver did not look for us in the waiting area he simply say outside waiting in his car.\n\nThey are (rightly) very strict on COVID measures as it poses a risk to the Orangutans so you need to get an antigen test before you arrive. They took us to get it  as part of the pick up service.    \n\nGreat for kids - they can help create the enrichment activities for the Sunbears and you can see the Sunbears up close. Our 8 year old loved it!",

      "text": "We stayed one day / two nights at the lodge. We watched feeding of the orangutans, and they are really beautiful animals, and it was a fantastic experience to see them. \nThe sun bears were less interesting. It was a very zoo/cage-like experience to meet them\nThe guide was nice, but insisted we wear face-masks at all times, which is super-hysterical for outdoor activities.\nWe also went on the river trip in the afternoon. It is a very long drive and part of the road to/fro the lodge is extremely bad. The boat engine was the most noisy boat engine I ever hear, and I heard a few…\nWe did see proboscis monkeys, but they also have a group where you board the boat, so the EXTREMELY noisy boat trip seemed a bit superfluous. Most of the way is quite boring, but we did see more proboscis, a kingfisher and a sleeping snake. I cannot recommend this trip due to the engine noise. \nThe lodge is beautiful and so are the rooms - with air con. Food is basic and to the very greasy side, but it’s tasty and well prepared. \nI can certainly recommend Samboja lodge!",

      "text": "This exceptional lodge located in a rainforest near Balikpapan, Borneo, offers first class accommodation and food on the grounds of the BOSF - an NGO to provide care and rehabilitation for displaced or orphaned orangutans. Our guide, Imam, showed us a number of orangutans and sun bears, took us on a motorized canoe to observe long nose monkeys and walked with us to a canopy bridge in a nearby rainforest. He professionally answered any questions about nature and culture. Cooking and service was outstanding - everyone always smiled - and we enjoyed cold drinks under the roofed patio of the lodge. We recommend the roof top lodge overlooking the rainforest. 3 unforgettable days!",

The work the BOS foundation does here is incredible and the tour guides are so well informed and can answer all your questions regarding anything Orangutans. I loved the fact that the orange primates were roaming on these islands just across a small river, easy to get good photographs, and the guides gave us plenty of time to just observe them in the wild.The orangutans there are in transition, it takes 13 years to actually release \"circus\", \"zoo\" and \"pet\" orangutans back into the wild, it is a privilege to witness what this foundation is providing to the endangered specie. The lodge and its surrounding is also an amazing haven to relax, read and just breathe in the beauty this jungle has to offer. I highly recommend and actually hope to have the opportunity to return one day!",

All these informations are also written on the book that is given to you at arrival at the Lodge\nIn fact, it is a SCAM because you are NOT allowed by the staff to do these activities, even if you show them all documents (vaccinations, findings of viral serologies and quantiferon).\nThus, I strongly do NOT recommend to stay in Sambodja Lodge. To spend a half day visit in that place is highly enough.",

The lodge is Very natural, far from noisy or busy sound of the city like you maybe face it. The lodge surrounded by plants, typical endemic trees of Borneo. There is internet, but no television. You can do activities by visiting the Orangutan Concervation centre which managed by BOSF Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation and also Sun Bears (or Beruang Madu), both are typical Borneo protected animals. \nThe road is little bid muddy If it rains. It is better If you bring or rent a 4 wheel drive vehicle (hoping local government can help improve the road infrastructure of this area someday).",

      "text": "Just wonderful! So tranquil, listening to the sounds of nature at the lodge was just sublime. We wish we could’ve stayed longer, but did not have the time. I was there with my American husband who hadd never been to Indonesia and my Australian brother in October 2018 (I am half Indo/half Aussie, living in the US for 16+ years). My husband and I stayed in one of the king suites with private balcony at the top of the tower which we absolutely loved. My brother stayed in a standard room which he really enjoyed, it was comfortable and has a long balcony shared with other rooms. The lodge was so peaceful and quiet, even though there were at least 20 other people there during our stay. The food was tasty, simple Indonesian fare served family buffet style. We saw the orangutans and sunbears (as I had done before with my mother back in 2011, but only during the day and we didn’t stay at the lodge). On this trip our guide got us to go inside one of the bear enclosures to hide and distribute the food in trees and in the long grass right before the bear feeding. A sneaky and daring wild macaque monkey also made an appearance and climbed into the enclosure looking for food. My brother also went on their river tour, where he saw wild proboscis monkeys swim across the river (some were carrying their babies), he said it was an amazing sight to see! He did mention that it was a shame to see garbage in and along the water the closer they got to villages/small towns. Coming back to BOS after 7 years I noticed that their forest was smaller when we went up to the lookout tower at the office. Our guide told us they lost quite a chunk of forest during a fire a few years ago, caused by local farmers. It is such a fragile eco system and was very saddening to see, BOS is trying hard to educate the local people and government on how important it is to conserve the forest and wildlife. I just feel it is still a losing battle and one that truly breaks my heart as my mother grew up in Samboja and it is just a hopeless feeling to see it change so much every time we go back and visit the area. But at least they are trying and integrating the local community with it, including some of my distant relatives who have worked or still work for BOSF. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Garuda Airlines is a donator of BOS Foundation; they even have a BOSF documentary showing in flight that we watched that was interesting and educational. I would recommend this lodge to anyone and to support their desperate fight for conservation. They also offer volunteer programs which I would love to do one of these days.",

I would also recommend the late afternoon river trip to see the proboscis monkeys.  \n\nThe lodge itself is comfortable - big rooms with hot water.  The food was good and plentiful.",

      "text": " We had originally hoped to do one of the river trips to see orangutans in the wild.  Unfortunately, we couldn’t coordinate that with visiting the Derawan Islands too.  I found a small write up of Samboja in one of the travel guides, so I explored the website, and we decided to give it a shot for 3 days.  For nature lovers, this is absolutely amazing.  The lodge is in the middle of a large forest where the Samboja organization is rehabilitating orangutans and sun bears that have been taken for pets around Indonesia.  The ultimate goal is to train the orangutans to be released in the wild. Unfortunately the sun bears cant be released right now. The lodge is a couple miles down a dirt road, and is a gorgeous wooden stucture, reminding me of lodges in the US National Parks. The rooms are simple, but provided all that is needed. All the rooms have forest views, and there is a viewing area in the upper tree canopy you can climb to.  We sat there for several hours enjoying the solitude and peace and sounds of the forest.  While sitting, all of a sudden a troop of macaques were playing in the trees and it was such a delight to watch.  Food was a good quality buffet, and they were willing to make special meals if requested.  The staff gives tours of the orangutan islands and the sun bears twice daily.  It was so wonderful to see the orangutans in the wild like this. We went on an optional tour to the “black river” one evening to see proboscis monkeys.  Was great, and the boat took us right past a local village out to the ocean.  Samboja is a place to go to relax and enjoy nature and peacefulness.  A previous reviewer complained there was nothing to do there—that is the point!  Definitely worth a stop.  And you will be supporting a great conservation organization.",

      "text": "What a great job these guys do, rescuing Orangutans and sun bears. The lodge is beautiful, serene, very comfortable and so well built. The views are spectacular and it was such a relaxing stay. Don’t expect to see a huge amount of Orangutans as most of the 140 Orangutans they have are at a different location which is not accessible to visitors as they are being rehabilitated or at the clinic getting medical treatment, but you do get to see a huge male Orangutan that lives on one of their islands, various females and a baby that was born there earlier this year. The Orangutans that live on the islands there were rescued from circuses or were pets and so cannot be reintroduced into the wild, but they are living here as close to being in the wild as possible. \nThe lodge also offer some day trips which were great to do. Carry on the good work!",

Once you arrived you feel relaxed. \n\n1st afternoon we visited the Sun Bears and watched them being fed. Our guides English was perfect and he was very patient  with the childrens questions.\n\nFood was basic but tasty and the beds very comfortable. We had booked the tower king but their was a water leak so we were given 2 queen rooms insead. Very comfortable rooms and beds with Mosquito nets.\n\nSlept like  a baby first night (and 2nd as well). \n\n2nd day saw the amazing Orangatans on their islands and again our guide was very knowledgable.\n\nWhilst it is a tad pricy, the money goes to a good cause and its well worth a 2 night stay to just get away from it all.\n\nNo TV, so bring books to read at night, or play pool vs the staff, and if you want mobile coverage, Telkomcel has the best coverage here.",

I booked this over the boat tours along the river as I thought the comforts of the hotel would be nicer overnight.  Other guests had bed bugs and once you checked in then the staff really did not care much further\n\nThe pre-arrival information was good offering various day trips and options. However when I arrived I discovered I could not leave my room or reception area without an escorted staff member. \nI was not free to visit all areas of the park along and only had access to 2 orangutan islands from afar. Everything else was off limits. I was told I needed 10 days for quarantine and they don’t let guests up close to the animals.\nThe day trips  basic and little animal wildlife to bee seen. \nAlcoholic drinks were overpriced a they had you in a captive market, however the funds go to a good cause.\n\nI was captive in the reception area and no outdoor space or hammocks to relax in the sunshine. \nMaximum one day stay is all you need here as there is very little to see or do\n\n",

      "text": "Myself and 2 girlfriends stayed at the Samboja Lodge Balikpapan part of The Great Projects experience. The Place is amazing tertiary rainforest and the humidity is about 90 per cent. It is excellent if you want to feel part of the forest but it is not the sort of place to relax by a pool. It is exotic but not luxury.There are lots of mozzies! Tourists were coming in and out on short visits or staying  to see the Orang Utans and Sunbears. The way they are cared for and in many cases returned to the wild is fantastic. It is educational and fascinating. We were there 2 weeks as we were working. It is an unforgettable place.  Some of the rooms only have cold water which is sometimes difficult. It is wonderful if you want to feel part of the jungle but don't want to actually sleep in a tent !! The food was very good but not fancy--which is fine and just really suitable to the environment...served in a restaurant  terrace open to the jungle. The bar serves beers.  We took a trip to the Black River with a local fisherman and that was a fantastic sunset cruise. The place is altogether wonderful and deserves support and visits for it's amazing work to help the environment and the extraordinary animals. The scenery and sense of peace are part of the overall beauty of the place.",

      "text": "On our way from the nearby Sun Bear feeding time and Bangkirai Treetops walk, we decided to detour to Samboja Lodge before continuing to the beach for a relaxing sunset snack. The access road is terrible, and must be much worse after heavy rain, but we were lucky and reached the Lodge after only 10 minutes. \n\nOn walking into the Lodge foyer, we were struck by the beauty of the architecture and the lush forest setting - breath-taking! We had a peek into the comfortably and well appointed rooms, each designed with a balcony and roomy private bathroom. The suite room in the corner had windows on 2 sides, like being in the middle of the forest. Perfect to spend a few days writing, contemplating, relaxing and being a part of this effort to rescue and rehabilitate orangutans displaced by habitat loss. \n\nA short walk down hill to the islands (they are building number 7!) was a treat. We strolled around one of the islands, encountering a magnificent flanged male. As the orangutans do not swim, these make perfect refuges, ideal for eco tourism.",

Air panas tidak menyala sama sekali, dijanjikan akan ada teknisi ke ruangan sejak kali pertama komplain sampai dengan saya tulis review ini tidak ada satupun teknisi yang cek ke kamar saya. Apa memang begini pelayanan hotel ini? Yg notabene bintang 3 menurut mereka? 4 hari 3 malam saya disini sudah 3 hari 2 malam saya komplain tidak ada tanggapan, cari MOD atau Duty Manager alasannya sibuk atau tidak ada. Maksudnya apa? Apa ini lelucon 😄? Tp jujur ini tidak lucu 😄 sama sekali!\n\nSaya menginap di Kamar 621.\nJeffrey Andrianto",

(finally we're allowed to check-in early). \n\nWhen entering room, the sink was clodged, so we're moved to other room. The interior was old, you can feel dust inside the room. I have bed light that don't have switch (my other room have the switch). \n\nAnd he worst part is that the water feel slimy/soap, when my wife ask then, they said it because they just clean out the water pond, and its already better condition from couple of days before (what  a terriblece work). \n\nOne tips for me, if you went here just because of the pool, be aware that the pool might be unavailable if someone book their ballroom for wedding since the ballroom are aside the pool (like me, they inform me that the pool will be close due to wedding event on Sunday).",

The room was pretty clean (could use some general maintenance though), the breakfast was good and the pool area was really nice! Unfortunately both the bar, the karaoke room and the nightclub was closed (don't know if it's always closed or we were just unlucky), so don't expect a party or a chill beer in the evening. Also the coffee in the room was expired, so the powder had turned into a weird paste kind of thing. Very nasty looking. \nI would come back to this hotel because of the nice pool, but don't expect anything extraordinary. ",

There was stains and human hairs  on the sofa. Biscuits and dirts on the carpets. It seems like the housekeeping in a hurry to clean it up...\nIn the bathroom, looks not very clean. There are many stains and human hairs on the floor. Look at the Bathtub, it looks like 10 years old or more.\nAt night, I didn't know what happened in the next room, but there were very noisy sound like many crowd chatting...is the wall soundproof?\nBut overall it is a nice hotel and professional staff...I like to be here...",

      "text": "I had a very good sleep during my stay in Balikpapan at sagita hotel. Worst things:\n\n1. The pillow sheet was stinks, really. Like some sweaty guy just slept on it and never changed the seet for 2 weeks.\n2. Since i stayed there for 2 weeks, the housekeeper was started to get ignorat, i could see dust on the furniture although it wasn't thick but it's not healthy. Also didn't clean the bathtub properly.\n3. The parking lot is a mess. It is hard to park there due to how they arrange the parking line.\n\nBest things:\n1. The bedroom has a good atmosphere to sleep, i slept really well during my 2 weeks stay there\n2. The location is near to good restaurants like Ocean fish connection, Balikpapan plaza, e-walk, dandito.\n3. Indonesian meal that they serve for breakfast are tasty, the rest are average. Every weekend they serve gado-gado as an alternative menu.",

Unfortunately the bath tub is broken, the water for shower are somehow yellow-ish color, the TV is still old fashion. Their WiFi worked for few hours during my stayed with a stable connection. However on the positive side, the staffs are nice and friendly. \n\nLocation wise, although it still quite close to the Shopping Center, you have to take a cab to reach Balikpapan Plaza.\n\nWill I going back? Most probably no....",

The wifi pass is changed every two hours so you have to call the front desk and get new pass.

Hotel Sagita is another one of those places. The rooms are nice, spacious, and the pool area, though lacking atmosphere, is slick and modern. However, a couple of issues with staff really undermined the experience. The fitness centre is mostly broken machines. It was ok, but not sure I would return.",

I walked-in on Saturday afternoon (7/May/16) as I was disappointed by another hotel which I booked a month before through the reservation agent or its staff. So I walked nearby and found Grand Tiga Mustika Hotel. The receptionist, Ms. Yuliana, welcomed warmly, provided clear information and made a good offer! I took the family room with reasonable rate including dinner and breakfast, local newspaper and wifi connection. Hotel has pool and close access to main road and Bakapai Park.\n\nThere were minor issues which I could tolerate, such as, dinner needs dessert and hot/cold drinks for completion. Telephone and mirror lighting were not working but was soon fixed by engineering. We were 3 adults but there were only 2 bath towels but it was delivered soon when requested. Overall it didn't ruin my stay there.\n\nNice courtesy and service too by Sisju Adi, responsible for the Housekeeping but he's quite going around the area. Any inquiries were also delivered to room immediately.\nGood hotel and staffs service to stay! Will stay there again when visiting my brother and recommend to my friends.",

My company booked me for one night just because they cannot find any hotels available during weekdays. I stayed at room 317, big room with extra bed, but not so clean and looks so old fashioned, and although it has a great sea-view. But I got problem with air condition, very old ones not really comfortable, also the TV remote was broken, so I have ask to be repaired, even they have to change with new one.  \nBreakfast is so poor, little variations of food, poor service. Definitely, I am not going back to this hotel for vacation.",

The corridor of the hotel, once you step of out of the lift, gives me creepy feeling and reminds me of the scene from Jack Nicholson's  'Shining' the Movie....Side table tidak dibersihkan dengan benar karena sisa2 sirop yang sticky bisa terlihat, the telephone collected dusts,  and what is worse, the pillows smell awful!!  I can tell the pillow cases are not changed from the previous guests.  Although on the surface, the bathroom looks clean, the shower area is grown with molds!  Needless to say that being in the hospitality business, you have to pay great attention to little details.  The lobby reeks of cigarettes smell as people freely smoke in the lobby, oblivious to other people who are subjected to smoke, same thing in the coffee shop area.  I dont know whether there is no regulation about public smoking in East Kalimantan or these smokers are just being plain selfish....  all in all, this hotel is a no no...",

Large room, bathtub, ceiling to floor windows, high ceiling, good housekeeping, morning newspapers, refrigerator, hotel sleepers, large parking area including basements, 2 elevators, emergency torch lights, nice sea views, close to airport - mall - my branch office, located on protocols street, various tv channels, hot water, the rates are low budget, breakfast menu are complete but the taste just so so, there is door man and so helpful on other side less hospitality for restaurant man staff, and hotel walls outdoors in maintenance so there is a lot of noice and craft man hanging on scaffolding outside. after all this hotel is recommended.",

      "text": "PROS - The whole hotel was presented fantastically and the rooms were well maintained and absolutely beautiful. The views from our room were amazing. We ate both breakfast and dinner in the restaurant, both days we were there, and the meals were great. The location was great, close to the airport and the major shopping areas. We went to Balikpapan, because my grandfather was wounded there in WWII, so we has a list of military sites we specifically see. We tried to arrange a driver to take us to these places, but had trouble finding a company who spoke English. We asked the staff at reception and they arranged for one of their own shuttle drivers to take us around.\n\nCONS - Our electronic room cards kept malfunctioning, so we spent a lot of time going up and down to reception to get into our room. Apparently the card system has difficulty understanding people staying more than one night. The staff's English was limited and we often had to wait until a certian person was working before we could get someone to understand what we were asking.",

Good big room, comfortable beds (with cotton sheets), good staff, good restaurant, good location (practically right opposite a huge mall with shops and restaurants). Cable tv with HBO movies in the room, and a huge buffet breakfast. On the outside it looks like a 4 star hotel, and it is really trying to be that. When the tv seemed to have bad reception they sent maintenance to sort it immediately (I was travelling with my son so cable was quite important for me on this trip).

The check in process was efficient and on complaining I'd been alocated a twin bedded room was quickly allocated a pleasant room with king size bed on the 5th floor. The room was quite large with a work desk and great TV. The bathroom was quite basic but large. The air-con and WiFi worked well.\nTrying to get dinner wasn't easy because most of the buffet was running out and I couldn't find a clean table in the restaurant so I ordered dinner for my room. The food was quite disappointing and I left most of it. I'd have gone out for dinner but the surrounding area was quite dark with broken pavements so I decided against that.\nBreakfast wasn't a happy experience as almost every table was occupied by people smoking so I found a table outside for an excellent omelette cooked just for me.",

      "text": "staff were OK but hotel was very run down. staff said the cheaper rooms were in a separate block without any lift and open corridors. they also face onto a huge construction site which operated as early as 630am some days and sometimes finished as late as 10.30pm. Dirty run down room with hair and cockroaches in bathroom. only positives were good location, good aircon and good wifi in room. sleeping was very poor due to no inroom sound insulation aswell as building work. there is a small swimming pool but wasnt very clean. stay elsewhere - but balikpapan isnt a great option for tourists in general.  breakfast was soso, as chicken/meat was recooked and gave me stomach problems... fruit was good",

Located in a great spot of the city near Bekapai Park where you can find various local street food stalls, and also near Balikpapan Trade Center and City Great Mosque, Attaqwa.\n\nThe hotel is a little bit odd, quaint to be frank, have murals on its entire walls. The environment is cozy, or maybe too quiet for a hotel. Breakfast is average, pool: nice, meeting room: small,  and I hope cleanliness can be improved. My room vent is dusty, and the blower too... they really need to improve for sure. ",

Decent restaurant serving great food and a good buffet breakfast. You can ask for eggs and they are happy to cook them for you). Great choice to stay here and excellent value for money.",

That time the lobby situation was crowded of wedding event and I saw the announcement on reception desk that the event was held on pool side, which I and Family could not use the pool facility that evening, It was a great concern as I promised my son and my niece that evening to swim and enjoy pool facility, as the next day I must fly back to Bali! I decided to leave and not to continue staying and moved to another hotel nearby, still on the same street.\n\nI directly wrote email that night to let them know my reason and disappointment but none of them get back to me until I'm writing this review now. I hope to stay at that hotel but with this experience it's difficult to be back again!",

I must walked through water boom area that only partially covered by roof and that time the rain was falling. It could be better if I enter the hotel through the other tower. \nAt the receptionist I must wait around 10 minutes because they were handling another guests. When it was my turn they found my room have been registered by my company but they were not sure whether someone have been checked in to my room or not. Then they must check directly to my room and I had to wait for another 10 minutes. After got my key I must walk through the water boom area again and it was still raining.\nFinally I could enter my room, but I found the blanket have some stains and the mat in the bath room was really dirty. I just opened the blanket and put away the mat. The room was small. The shower area in the bath room was also very narrow.\nWhen I wanted to check out on 7 AM I called the receptionist where should I check out and they said I must check out at the same receptionist with last night because the receptionist on my tower was not open yet. So I must walk again through the water boom area and it was still raining. ",

      "text": "We have Booked the hotel few days ago with their reservation, somehow Upon Check in our reservation were not listed, so we have to wait a while to get a room, once we enter the room we get a room with construction view and workers in front of the balcony, the room was not well prepared, we booked two rooms and one of the rooms don't have a curtain and another room wastafel sink hole were broken... also we booked for 1 Double Bed + 1 Twin Bed, but somehow they gave us only Double bed\n\nSo we need to change room, but when changing the room they did not send a bellboy to help us with our luggage... so we manage to drag it all on our own.... Also the staff who escorted us dont even give a brief explanation about the room and facility, they just handover the key and whalla gone right away... Now the breakfast was just not good, most of the meal were tasteless and very2 mediocre... Just not worth it for the Price of room that we Pay... Many other better options for similar or even cheaper room rates\n\nStaff at the front office were also not so friendly, might need more training on handling customer, when we say we have book a room with Mr. A on reservation department, and they replied Have You Paid? (With an accusations tone as if the room were not booked because we havent paid for it) meanwhile the reservation staff said we can pay upon arrival at the front desk.\n\nThe Positive side was that the rooms and hotel area are very clean and well maintain, they have big swimming pool with slide available, and the location is very strategic located inside the Balikpapan Super Block where there are plenty of shops / mall / restaurant / sports facility/ Movie Theater and others",

Location pretty central.... plaza not far away ... taxi service ok but paying for parking every time you get a taxi to the front door ..\n mmmmmm !!! .....staff friendly enough to help ...., pool .. to much clohorine ...

      "text": "Was on a business trip to Balikpapan, happened to see this hotel in the Pentacity mall campus, made arrangements for booking. Reached on a Sunday evening, taxi from airport to hotel 70k. Hotel has two entrances, the North Tower (adjacent to Starbucks of pentacity mall) and South tower (opposite to Ruby Towers apartments). Reception functions at the 7th floor for both the towers separately.  The Aqua swimming pool cum theme park with water slides is just between reception and restaurant Aqva Palm. Check in was swift. Room at 11th floor access through elevator by card access only. Good safety. Rooms looked new, toiletries OK (dental kits, shower cap, shaving kit, lotion, comb, disposable bag for sanitary purposes, ear buds, etc) Hand wash lotion canister, shampoo canister and body gel canister were available and topped up regularly. Towels though not great quality were neat, clean and a pair kept. Slippers were of surprisingly good quality with the Astara mark. At the south tower were sea view rooms with Ruby towers blocking the complete view. Room service was fine, restaurant bfast is OK. Food taste is fine but variety could be brought in. The restaurant has a lounge bar, good with arrangements for smoking outside. I believe the rates could be brought down a little for a parity to value you get. I would appreciate the Malaysian duty manager who stepped in over a confusion at the restaurant on room charging. Good person with great presence of mind. Restaurant and bar staff are working hard, especially that little girl at the kitchen with a Gilbab and Lion, the bar tender. My appreciation to Dewi and all restaurant staff for locating my credit cards box at the restaurant and bringing it to my room. I would have been in trouble otherwise. Good honest people. In all I enjoyed my stay there which was for almost 12days. Will book again if I need to visit the place.",

But the customer service staff at the check in counter were always smiling and patient.\nWhen I was in my room, the wifi had connecting issue and there was no instruction given on how to function the TV as well. The shower area water drainage was blocked but the staff was patient to get all fixed up. \nThis hotel is great for family but not for anyone looking for facilities. The Swimming pool is more of a public pool. The place is open to the public. The dinning area is too small for a hotel that attracts family. \nBut I must thank Mr. Erik, he is one of the best service duty manager that I had ever come across in all the hotels that I had stayed in Indonesia. He took the trouble to service you at his best and came to the room personally to ensure that everything run well for me. \nThe company should treasure this manager. He deserved to be promoted so that he could lead more people to give quality service like him. ",

Breakfast is noisy, as construction workers are constantly hammering above.\nThere is currently no private pool for hotel guests so do not expect to get a chair near the pool. No showers could have been found near to pool. So seems no one in showering before entering pool.\nTo sum up: very poor quality of the building contractor, very poor maintenance, badly managed...\nStay somewhere else...\n",

I love the room as it was very comfortable, and the pool is fun. they have huge waterpark inside the hotel. the breakfast was delicious and they have a lot of variety. the only lacking during my stay was the staffs, they are really slow. maybe because it was at the weekend so there were a lot of people.

Review yg sy lihat memang kondisinya mengecewakan, dan itu benar saat spt sy menginap kemarin. Tidak ada handuk, tidak ada remote AC, tidak ada remote TV. Karena kelelahan, sy jd tidak bisa atur suhu AC di kamar, alhasil kedinginan sepanjang istirahat.\nTidak ada air hangat. Dan sy tebak kamar yg sy tinggalin belum pernah ditinggalin. Saat sy buka kran air, yg pertama keluar airnya berwarna coklat (mungkin krn tidak pernah dipakai). Kondisi kamar mandi jg mengecewakan. Utk kamar standar ekonomi memang tidak bisa dijadikan utk tempat tinggal yg nyaman. Beruntung sy hanya 7 jam saja disana.",

Paying 750,000 Rph 1 night stay inclusive with breakfast. \nHygiene is poor and ridiculuos, never experience such bad smell pillow , mattress , sofa in a 3 star hotel before . I guess the hotel has no interest in hospitality or management dont care what is accomodation. \nThe whole night no internet connection . DM response IT not around and she can't reset router. Most of the electric plug is not usable. Electric wire is everywhere behind the bed side table , and can't charge.  The only appreciation is the restaurant staff , is very helpful and friendly. \n\n",

At night, there are several culinary options that can be an alternative to having dinner outside the hotel, so I can save more on my business trip costs.

You can visit many places in Balikpapan from this hotel.\n\nThe basement parking area is spacious. Once you got in to the lobby, You can check in to the great staff and get a card. The card is the key too your room. It's also an access tool to enable the elevator to go to upper floors. So if you ordered something online (food, drink etc.) your delivery guy cannot come up to your room since you need a card to access the upper floors. The room itself is nice. You get a really clean room and bathroom. Breakfast there is awesome, you get good food and service from the staff. The wifi quality is not that great. You can't even watch a YouTube video on great quality. On the opposite side of the hotel is a mosque. It could be noisy around 6 P.M but a great feature for muslims.\n\nOverall, it's a great hotel. You get good food, good service and clean rooms if you decided to check in to the hotel.",

When I heard a new hotel open near the Airport, I can't wait to give it a try and lucky for me it pays of. From check in everything went smoothly, room is very spacious with complete amenities and to my surprise they even provide a body pillow, instantly I feels like home.\n\nSleeping quality was great, breakfast menu is good. There are some works in progress but when its finished I am sure will compliment the already great services to the hotel.",

Kemudian saya masuk kamar, ternyata musiknya masih terdengar keras, saya pun merasa terganggu ketika shalat, kemudian ada surat edaran yang isinya management meminta maaf karena berisik, dan acara musik itu dari 18:00 hingga 00:00. Karena saya merasa kecewa, saya belum sampai 1 jam berada di kamar, saya telpon receptionist untuk komplain dan meminta refund. Percuma juga kan stay di hotel yang tidak bisa digunakan untuk beristirahat. Namun permintaan refund ditolak, dan bila saya ingin segera check-out maka dikenakan charge 300rb. Lucu juga, saya udah keluar biaya taxi untuk sampai ke hotel, namun hotelnya tidak berfungsi sebagai hotel, bukannya ditawarkan ganti rugi malah dikenakan charge 300rb. Saya minta bicara dengan managernya, eh managernya libur karena hari minggu.\n\nDi hotel ini juga tidak ada lift, jadi saya harus angkat tas saya yang beratnya 20kg melalui anak tangga. Koridor tidak rapi, seperti renovasi yang mangkrak. Di dalam kamarpun berdebu.\n\nPengalaman yang sangat mengecewakan!",

      "text": "I stayed in this hotel for 5 days and 4 nights. Altogether the stay in the hotel was nice and the price, after a bit of negotiation, was fair. Some things were very nice but some things also were kind of a setback, that is why altogether it is just average. Renovation of bathrooms and upgrading the aircons would definitely lead to a better judgement.\nThe location of the hotel is somewhat remote from malls and the center of the town, taking a taxi or a local van is necessary but easy and affordable to do.\nThe room is huge and nicely decorated with a desk and a modern television. The bed is nice, sheets are clean. The aircon is too small and too old though, to keep the room cool. In my case it had to work day and night and still it was not really cool enough at times when it was hot in the day.\nThe bathroom is a bit of a disappointment, old and somewhat smelly, without a shower curtain. Provided soaps are nice but toilet, shower and sink are very old. Bathroom definitely needs renovation. \nThe breakfast is nice. Served in the nice restaurant with a small buffet with abundant local food, several dishes to choose from as well as bread and marmelade for the \"buleh\" type of visitors. Maybe something could be done about the coffee though. Just serving coffee powder (no not instant coffee but real coffee powder) to \" prepare\" a cup of coffee is somewhat too primitive for a hotel that aims to have a certain quality standard. \nPersonnel in the reception, cleaning and restaurant I experienced as somewhat slow but certainly serviceable, friendly and polite.",

Despite the great walking distance to shopping center, the hotel staffs are quite paranoid with guests running away from the hotel without paying. I already paid almost double the amount of money for so call \"Deposit\" yet I was getting called on the phone at 10.40pm and they even sent a guy to knock on my door checking whether the guest is in the room or not.\n\nWhat make the matter worse, after checking out the hotel called me on the mobile asking about a snack that I consumed from their minibar...can't they bother to check first whether the snacks belongs to the hotel or not, before calling the guest?\n\nFor 400.000 / Night in this paranoid hotel, I would rather spend elsewhere.",

      "text": "Nama besar, chain hotel, low rate, dan termasuk hotel legendaris di balikpapan menjadi alasan utk menginap di mirama balikpapan. Luas kamar standard cukup untuk single occupancy. Kebersihan rata-rata. Big led tv dengan banyaknya premium channel. Ada deposit rp. 50 ribu yang dikembalikan saat check out. Parkir luas. Lokasi pusat kota. Hot water bagus.\nMengambil standard room dimana view jendela adalah koridor antar kamar dan ditutup roller blind sehingga masih ada sisi yang terlihat dari koridor (no privacy). Ambience kamar seperti karaoke room. Bathroom Exhaust fan tidak aktif. Karena kamar berada di tengah bangunan maka sinyal handphone lemah, mencoba free wifi pun lemah. Tidak kedap suara mungkin karena ada bagian dinding yang bukan dari tembok semen. Saat check out pukul 4.30 turun dari kamar lantai 3 ke reception lantai 1 hendak menggunakan lift rupanya tidak berfungsi sehingga turun lengkap membawa tas dengan tangga.  dengan direnovasi hanya tak seperti yang diharapkan. Untuk hotel dengan nama besar ini sangat disayangkan, tidak direkomendasikan. ",

      "text": "Terrible unfortunately. I know this hotel is under renovation and most of the hotel is being completed (maybe by mid 2012) but the standard of the existing available rooms s terrible.\n\nThe first impression I had of the hotel was a good one as the foyer and lobby are very grand looking and clean, the staff were very helpful and accommodating as well. However that all changed when I entered my room, I had a deluxe room (king sized bed) and found it to be very dirty. There were maggots crawling out from under my bedside table and someone had dropped a packet of food down there which was covered in them. There were cigarette butts in the ashtray even though I was told it was a none smoking room. I asked to change rooms which after I had to show the manager why he agreed. My new room was not much better, still bits of rubbish on the floor and hairs in the shower and also in my bed which told me they hadn't changed the sheets since the last occupants. My shower had no screen or curtain and as a result the toilet and bathroom floor were covered in water after a shower. \nThe paint was falling off the walls, the TV had very bad reception, the air-conditioner worked part time and the internet was (when it was working) at dial-up speed, the linen was old and had holes in it, the rooms smelt musty and dirty. There were many other issues with the room but these were definitely the worst.\nThe hotel advertises several restaurants but they are not open, the main restaurant is only open for breakfast otherwise you have to eat in the cafe which has a very limited menu. There is a pizza hut attached to the hotel and it is only about a five minute walk to a large shopping centre which has plenty of food establishments and shops.\nOverall, the only thing this hotel has going for it presently is it's location, although for about $20 extra a night, you can get a better location and a proper four star hotel, which is where I am staying now as I had to move out.\nThere are much better places to stay in Balikpapan and for very little extra money, so until the renovations are finished and hopefully better cleaning staff, I would stay away from this place",

Setelah saya lihat kondisi hotelnya sangat mengecewakan. Kmrnya agak kotor dan spreinya agak bau. Krn itu saya batalkan pesanan saya. Saya pindah ke hotel pacific yg letaknya tidak begitu jauh dgn hotel benakutai. Dgn harga rp. 430 ribu include breakfast. Hotelnya sangat nyaman dan bersih, sangat jauh dgn kondisi kmr dibenakutai. Mohon utk benakutai utk dijaga kebersihannya. Maaf saya tidak sempat utk memfoto keadaan kmr2 hotel tsb. Trims\n",

Tapi setelah melihat hotel benakutai yg sekarang sungguh jauh berbeda, jadi saya segera melangkahkan kaki kehotel ini dan kembali kepelukan kotaku.hotel ini terletak di tengah keramaian kota saya teringat saat pergi sekolah saya selalu melewati hotel ini karena sekolahan saya ada dulu berada di belakang hotel jadi memory saya. \nSaat masuk kelobby ada beberapa tempat yg berubah dan yg di pertahankan. \nUkiran kayu ulin khas kalimantan selalu ada. \nRoom hotel ini sangat luas dg fasilitas komplit hotel bintang jadi tidak usah bingung. \nApalagi hotel ini dekat dengan mall dan juga pertokoan dan tdk jauh dari hotel kita bisa berjalan kepinggir laut unyuk menikmati udara laut dan makan sea food ala balikpapan.\nDi hotel pun kita bisa rental mobil jika kita hendak bepergian jauh tapi jika jika tahu arah kita bisa menggunakan angkutan umum yg berjalan 24 jam jadi mudahkan\nBenakutai aku akan kembali lagi \nTerimakasih untuk semua staf hotel yg sdh memberi pelayanan dg sangat baik……. Thanks",

Asalnya adalah hotel Bena Kutai yang sudah lama berdiri di Kota Balikppapan, Kota Minyak. Banyak property digunakan yang cukup khas di Kalimantan yaitu penggunaan kayu untuk duduk-duduk santai. Waktu santai di sore hari setelah penat seharian mengikuti acara \"meeting\" sambil duduk di kayu, sambil diiringi dengan lantunan live musik. Cukup ramah pelantun lagunya. \" Selamat sore mas-mas yang barusan masuk\", sapanya. Langsung kami duduk santai menikmati lagu yang dibawakan. Di mejapun juga telah disediakan majalah yang dapat dibaca untjuk menambah wawasan tentang kota Balikapapan dan Kalimantan Timur pada umumnya. Kamarnya sangat luas dengan harga yang sangat terjangkau. Tidak salah jika anda berkunjung ke kalimantan Timur, menginap di Hotel New Benakutai.",
