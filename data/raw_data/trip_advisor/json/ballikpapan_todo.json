Pantai ini sangat indah, dengan pasir putih dan ombak yang tenang. Jika Anda hobi renang, maka jangan lupa untuk membawa pakaian renang terbaik Anda, karena struktur pantai yang landai dan jumlah karang yang sedikit menjadikan pantai ini cukup sempurna untuk melakukan aktivitas di air. Pemandangan langit di sore hari sangat mengesankan, dengan biasan cahaya matahari yang mulai tenggelam menghasilkan siluet langit berwarna jingga dan ungu, sangat sempurna bagi landscape photography.\nUntuk menikmati pantai ini, sedikit biaya masuk akan dikenakan kepada para wisatawan, yaitu (jika tidak salah) IDR 3.000 untuk anak-anak dan IDR 5.000 untuk dewasa.\nPantai ini dapat diakses dengan menempuh perjalanan sekitar 30 menit dari kota Balikpapan ke arah timur laut menggunakan kendaraan pribadi. Saya tidak yakin apakah ada transportasi publik yang menuju rute ini, sehingga menyewa kendaraan roda dua merupakan pilihan yang cukup logis untuk saya.",

      "text": "Transmart, a one way ticket to enjoyment for 30 minutes and a shopping center. It was a huge place for a supermarket with an amusement park, it was 5 minutes ride from my house since it's very near with the location. Transmart located at Mt Haryono road in South of Balikpapan.\n\nIt was a nice shiny day, so my ride to the location was okay.\n\nAs we arrive at the location, the surrounding areas aren't really that crowded. Most of the visitor who at the location are mostly just for shopping. At the first brief look I weren't expecting much about the shopping are since my real target was the amusement park at the 3rd Floor. After we manage to arrive at the place. most of the rides that available aren't really my type. 75% of the ride were targeted for children like  City convoy, Bumpy cars, Happy swing, Sky rider, Soft Play. And the only adult ride that I found a bit enjoyable is the roller coaster. After 30 minutes of walking around searching for the perfect ride for me, slowly but surely I'm starting to bored, most of my sister and brother still have the energy to enjoy the fun. In the end it's just a waste of time for me.\n\nTo cover my boredom, me and my mother goes to the 2nd floor for shopping. I weren't expecting that much space for a huge row of aisles. For a supermarket in Balikpapan it was fully available in needs of household. I was overwhelmed on how much things that I need to fulfill. After shopping for a whopping 4 hours, followed with everyone finished doing the rides, We go to the cashier to pay and finally able to go home and take a rest.\n\nIn the end, I'm a bit mixed about the place. As in for the amusement park, I found it quite unenjoyable and boring, but I get it that this studio is small and it's called mini  trans studio so make sense. Yet if you want to at least have fun and waste your time with you're family, I highly suggest for you to visit this place and also the price for the entrance is very cheap and affordable for everyone. And for the supermarket I very suggested you to try to go shopping here as I found it very fully stocked in daily needs and most of the price are economical.",

Some daily care, like refill for  fabric freshener, only we can meet there. For these reasons, we go there.\n\nBut our kids know that they can play at the playground. We use that moment. When they tired after playing, go around the supermarket to accompany me buy some daily needs (they got something they need too), will make them hungry. Buy some foods also our choice. \n\nSo its like 1 stop shop for us where we can buy daily needs, children can have some enjoy moment to play and also the food itself. So I don't have to think about our family menu, hahaha. We like the bakery shop too. Our favorites are mini danish cookies. But by any chance, we bored with this place.\n\nNothing new. Children felt that way either. No new challenge at the playground. So sometime, if we got bored, we will find another place. Even if it makes me not to have all the daily need in one place. üòâüòâ",

      "text": "Transmart is a decent place to spend your afternoon at.\n\nIt follows a concept of a big multi-storey shops with one gated check out system at the entrance. Basically once you went it, you could go to the second and third floor still carrying the items that you grab from the first floor. Once you're finished then you just go down to the first floor to check out. \n\nAt the top there's a mini theme park, meant for kids really because the attraction's seating arrangement and sizes are quite small. There's a rollercoaster inside for those who want to take their kids for a non-extreme fun indoor. \n\nOverall, the place is quite clean, and quite spacious to walk around in. The bakery at the first floor is amazing! Try to come early when they just finished baking it. Its cheap and quite decent really.\n\nOne minus for me is the parking lot and the pavement leading up to the entrance. Parking lot could be bigger and the pavement have a lot of holes. \n\nOther than that it's quite recommended at least for a single visit.",

I took some pictures of the city scrapers and the couples and some group of people just hanging around waiting for the sunset.\nMy last visit, two weeks ago, I explored the rugged beach (the right side of the beach to the direction of Melawai Beach). There is a little rugged rock where people like take pre-wedding picture. When you climb up the rock and you can find another secluded little beach. If you walk further, you can take picture of the hill scattered by houses. This used-to-be ford location, is a good place to take picture of the sunset. Over weekend you will find many photographers here.",

It was such a pleasurable experience and I‚Äôd really like to share that with you.\n\nI felt very secure upon reaching as I had to go through a temperature check and security check to make sure that everything was alright and that I was fit to enter the mall. Then the hand sanitizing station to ensure that our hands are clean upon entering.\n\nI then had lunch at The People‚Äôs Cafe which was an amazing experience. I ordered the fish & chips which I really like and iced tea. The food was delicious. I then went to have a drink at Kokumi which is a bubble tea store. I really enjoy their Okinawa Brown Sugar. You should request for less sugar because it can be a little too sweet.\n\nI then walked around the mall as there are ample stores to explore, clothing stores, shoe stores, and many more. My favorite store has to be Miniso as they sell a plethora of home goods.\n\nAs covid is still rampant in town, I had to cut my window shopping short, so that was all I did for my day at Pentacity mall.\n\nI really enjoyed my day there, and I wish that when the pandemic is over, I get to walk around it more freely than I can now.",

Pentacity is a mall that had been built since 2018 and it is built beside another mall which is called E-walk, which has been there since the early 2010s. Although this mall is not as big as malls in other cities, this mall has provided more than enough entertainment for the residents of Balikpapan, ranging from cinemas, restaurants, clothing stores, supermarkets, etc., all available there. If you want to buy branded clothes, there are several branded clothes shops that you can visit for example H&M, Sogo, Hush puppies or for example you want to eat there, there are many choices of restaurants, ranging from Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Indonesian food. So it can be concluded that this mall is a suitable place to visit for family entertainment for those of you who may come from outside the city of Balikpapan and are natives of the city of Balikpapan.",

There are different shops and places in Pentacity, they have Starbucks, Kokumi, and many different kinds of restaurants but both of the examples are my favorite drinks in Pentacity. Not only does Restaurant Pentacity have a swimming place named Aqua Boom it‚Äôs a fun place because there‚Äôs a lot of slides in Aqua Boom and it‚Äôs a great place to relax talking about relaxed Pentacity have movie theatre called XXI, but it's also a great place to watch movies with friends or family.

Pentacity is a very unique mall because it linked to another mall called E-walk, just like Tunjungan Plaza at Surabaya.  Pentacity is more modern than E-walk, but the type of shops still complement each other (There are Pizza Hut, Funstation, The Executive and many more on E-walk. While Pentacity have Hypermart, KFC, H&M etc). Not just that, but around Pentacity there is shop house and also hotels which tourist can sleep beside on the mall. I like Pentacity more because I like japanese food and there are many japanese restaurant on Pentacity, and also there is cinema and I really like watching movies especially Marvel Movies. However, I don't really like the escalator arrangement because the mall is like circular-shaped and we need to walk a semi-circle of it to go to the next level or lower level of the mall. But I still very recommend to go here when the virus Covid-19 is gone, you can do many things here like hangout with friends, watch cinema with family, shopping and many other things.",

Since this mall is a new mall, the design is modern and very pretty for me. The design is very calming, with white color vibe which is very high class. The toilet, comparing to BSB mall‚Äôs is much more clean and designed more modern. Nonetheless, there is a restaurant which makes me loss my appetite. The place is very dirty and smells very bad.. Even it is still new, there are many things we could find there such as restaurants, fashion stores (which is very millennial), supermarket, game center, snack sellers, even cinema and many more. Many popular brands such as SOGO, H&M, Charles & Keith and many more. There are also hotels near, even in the area of the mall. I personally like Pentacity out of all mall in this city. There are many empty spots in this mall since it is a new mall, but I believe this mall will develop even better. I absolutely recommend you to visit Pentacity if you are in Balikpapan. It is very suitable for any ages, especially for millennial kids like me.",

I personally liked going to the beach but I won't be able to go out for a while due to the pandemic. No need to fret, I'm about to share my personal thoughts about it so readers like you can have a general idea about it :)\n\nIt was around 7 months ago since I've last gone out to have fun in the sun and as vaguely as I remember, it was quite bright and perfect for tanning. I'm not a fan of tanning my skin but it does feel great to dip your toes in its cooling saltwater. \n\nTemperatures aside, this beach is filled with many activities you can do with your family. For instance, I went out in mid-February for a relaxing day with the whole family and we had a picnic there near the forest opening. The little ones tend to dugout pits and try to capture as many snails and whelks from the shore. It was warm, and yet, it felt really breezy and refreshing since there's so many trees towering over us with shade.\n\nThere isn't much rubbish around the sandy areas, but sadly, the water was murky and trash seems to washed-up often to the seashore so we tend to avoid it in order to avoid any rashes or some sort. \n\nThe people there are definitely friendly and there is a lot of space to do outdoor sports and things alike. I would definitely recommend people to visit this beach.",

This is primarily a muslim area and we were a group of non-muslims so we got stared at for wearing our swimmers. After being in the water our small group sat on the grass area undere trees to have a chat and a beer (we brought our own) we were approachd by many muslim family groups as they wanted to have their photo taken with uss (we were the only white people on the beach).  It was lovely and they were tickled pink to have a photo taken with us.  Other than that it was not much of a beah at all (Im used to Australian beaches).",

Because the entire park is not maintained. \n¬†¬†¬† - All walls and safety gates are VERY OLD and almost ready to fell over. NOT SAFE FOR KIDS...LOOK AFTER YOUR CHILDREN.\n¬†¬†¬† - Conditions of detention: all enclosures are small. Sometimes maybe 20 massive crocodiles in a little enclosure. Sometimes 3 massives in 6m square. Some enclosures have¬† around 40 babies...definitely not enough space to make them happy and free to grow up. The water is never changed and full of rubbish, empty plastic bottles, peanuts plastic bag, tyres...sometimes kind of wooden construction with still nails on it.\n¬†¬†¬† - Apparently you can try/taste crocodile. !!DON'T!! HYGIENE IS NOT RESPECTED. It's smelling so strong and the place where they do/prepare it, is opened and literally next to the crocodiles enclosure.\n¬†¬†¬† - NO guides to explain you the site and about crocodiles.\n¬†¬†¬† - At the exit they sell some \"crocodile oil\" apparently good for skin!! WHAT ARE THEY REALLY DOING WITH CROCODILES???\n    - You can also see Peacock, little monkey, kind of eagles, and a big bird in cage! With no water, never cleaned, rubbishes, not enough space to move. The peacock is very aggressive, monkeys are looking/waiting for care and affection. And one of the birds is looking disfigured probably by himself coz of the life condition! \n\nIF YOU HAVE A HEART...DONT GO THERE, DON'T WASTE MONEY BUT ABOVE ALL...DON'T GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THIS PEOPLE WHO DON'T RESPECT ANIMALS.",

For the taxi way to +waiting +return we paid all in all 170.000 rp . Entrance for 2 ppl is 50.000 rp. However you can have 2 km return nice board walk. We saw mangrove trees , crabs, little fish's, monkeys etc. ... no mosqitos :) \n\nInformation are only in indonesian. It seems that all comments in tripadvisor are from indonesians in english. I am sure it will look different at low / high tide or different day times. We went there at noon at low tide.\n\nRubbish around as everywhere indonesia.\n\nAll in all it was okay but the best thing to do in balikpapan.",

  "description": "Kawasan Wisata Pendidikan Lingkungan Hidup (KWPLH), which translates to Environmental Education and Recreation facility, or colloquially also known as the Sun Bear Center, is an environmental education facility located 23 km north of Balikpapan in East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. In 2002, the Sun Bear was proposed as the mascot of Balikpapan, fuelled by the first research project on wild sun bears carried out in the field in the Sungai Wain Protection Forest located without Balikpapan City boundaries. Since 2004, the City Government has collaborated with private donors and wildlife experts to develop the sun bear education center, the centerpiece of which is a 1.3 ha natural enclosure housing 7 sun bears that can never be released into the wild. This is enclosure is widely recognized as one of the best of its kind in Asia, and increasing numbers of tourists (70,000 in 2013), domestic and foreign, can see the mascot of Balikpapan in a natural environment. In 2008, a Sun Bear information exhibit, the largest and most comprehensive of its kind in Asia, was opened at the Centre, followed by an education exhibit focusing on Domestic animal care versus Wildlife not suitable as pets. In 2014 a new exhibit focusing on the rich Endemic Flora and Fauna of Borneo was opened. Plans are under way to develop further exhibits with environmental themes, such as the different ecosystems and their functions from mountains to the sea in Borneo. The Centre has also developed a rescue facility for stray and abandoned cats and dogs, also providing the public with information on pet care. In addition, over the years, attractive gardens and outward bound facilities have been developed, and visitor numbers have increased steadily. The majority of visitors are local schoolchildren, community groups and families wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a few hours. To date the site developments have largely been funded through donations, while the basic running costs have been funded by the city government. The site currently employs 41 staff, 80% of whom are from local communities.",

In this place there was so many of information that u can see wherever you are, which is it‚Äôs good so beside we can see the animal we also can learn something new and get more knowledge. Although i had visited this place when i was in kindergarten but i still remember how this place looked like because it‚Äôs so memorable and I really enjoyed. If we visit this place of course we want to see the sun bear and we can see the sun bear at a considerable distance but we still can see the sun bear clearly but there also place for people can see directly the sun bear and the guides who will help us to see everything in this place.  Beside a place where we can see the sun bear they also have another place such as souvenir center, play ground, dining area, and a lamin house. This is a fun place and if i can get a chance to visit this place again then I would like to visit.",

From sun bears until flora and fauna information centers. In this place they also provide a souvenir center, dining area, flower gardens, playgrounds, and a lamin house that can be used for documentary film shows, educational panel appearances, and other events. One of the most enjoyable things is we can see directly the sun bear doing their activities such as eat, roam around, and even sleep. \n\nIf I had another chance to visit this place after this pandemic I would spend more time enjoying their amazing places and explore more about sun bears. I recommend you to visit this place in the morning or evening. based on my own experience, at that time I went in the middle of the day so it made me feel hotter and drained a lot of energy to explore this place. \n\nYou must visit this place!

The naturalised enclosure for the sun bears have raised boardwalks around most of the area that allows viewing from above, especially during feeding time which is always a great opportunity for photos. The guides that work at the centre are very enthusiastic, passionate, and articulate with educating the general public about the sun bears and the conservation issues that they face. Lots of effort has gone into the environmental education exhibits throughout the property on; sun bears, endemic flora and fauna of Borneo, and domestic animals.\n\nThere is also a small vet clinic and adoption centre for domestic animals that are being looked after on the property also. An important initiative to educate the public about being responsible pet owners. An insightful experience!",

The walking and viewing platforms are very narrow so it was a bit of a crush and viewing was not easy for the small kids we had with us. They only have two viewings a day at 9am and 3pm so you need to get there early. We wandered around the grounds and the kids played on the playground equipment however much of it was in a bad state of disrepair and quite frankly, dangerous so they couldnt enjoy the facilities.

Not welcome out in the villages, these now socialised individuals have to remain in captivity. We walked along a bridge to a pile of old tree branches, where keepers had hidden fruit and painted honey. Immediately on release from their dens, the bears animatedly searched the area to retrieve all the fruits.\nI enjoyed seeing the bears in a good quality enclosure and looking very healthy at a safe distance.

He said it would be half an hour but it was much more. You're taken through the mangroves - spooky places - and eventually the river opened out and there were forests on either side. After seeing some rustling leaves high up in the trees we slowly approached and were surprised to see many proboscis monkeys jumping from tree to tree and screeching as they did. Further on a similar thing happened. It was not easy to get pictures as they were so quick but I managed one. We were told that there were crocodiles around but we didn't see any. Apparently they are not interested in human flesh, but like to go for the monkeys when they venture into the water.\nGreat experience.",

Booking was easy with just an sms sent to the founder's number. I don't think booking is necessary though because they have a few boats and can just take anyone walking in - unless they are serving big groups.\nThey charge per boat (IDR 300K), so it's better not to take the ride alone. If you're going solo, you can ask if you can join another group so you can share the cost. \nThe whole boat ride was pretty short (about 1 hour) and the guide I had did not explain much unless I asked him questions. I did see some Bekantans on the trees and it was pretty cool. The guide would stop the boat a bit longer at the spots where we could see Bekantans.\nDon't forget to bring a mosquito repellent spray / lotion because the mosquitos are pretty crazy. They told me the best times to do it in the morning (7-ish am) and in the afternoon (4pm-ish). These are the times when the Bekantans are out for food so you have bigger chances of spotting them.\n ",

      "text": "I have lived in Balikpapan my entire life and compared to other cities I've been to, Balikpapan is the most comfortable city to live in and visit. \n\nBalikpapan City is one of the cleanest cities in Indonesia; it has received 19 Adipura Awards and 4 Adipura Kencana Awards, these to cities that receive Adipura Awards for three consecutive years. Adipura is an award for cities in Indonesia that are successful in urban environmental management and city cleanliness. Based on Indonesian Most Liveable City Index which measured 27 indicators for every two years, Balikpapan is the best city for living in 2013 and toppled Yogyakarta as the best in 2011 and 2009. Balikpapan mainly maintained city management aspects and environmental wellbeing. These prove that Balikpapan is a pleasant and conducive city.\n\nBalikpapan is not a large metropolitan city like Jakarta and Surabaya. But I consider Balikpapan as a hidden gem for tourists; it is a hot spot for nature tourism. It has many natural and wildlife areas that you can visit, ranging from a mangrove forest to a sun bear conservation center. Not to mention, Balikpapan is a coastal city, you can find many beaches here. Try visiting Melawai Beach, the most popular beach among local citizens. You can eat lots of good food while enjoying the calming ambiance of the beach.\n\nSo, if you are a true nature lover, or if you are looking for a comfortable destination to visit, you should come and visit Balikpapan.",

Balikpapan has the beautiful forest that habited with variated of flora and fauna named ‚ÄúHutan Lindung Sungai Wain‚Äù. This tropical forest was protected by the government but as a tourist we can still visit. But because of the muddy mud I recommend you to use boot or you can visited on dry season. the journey to the forest will be a little far and tiring so don't forget to bring food/drink supply, even so feeling tired will be pay off with a very beautiful view.\nNot only amazing forest, balikpapan also has beautiful beaches. There is one beach that I highly recommend, namely Melawai beach, besides you can enjoy the beautiful beach there is also famous for typical Balikpapan street food which is only available there, the name is \"grilled corn\" anyway if you go to Balikpapan it is really mandatory to go to this beach.\nThere are many more places you can visit in this city, besides the city is really clean, you will get a comfortable atmosphere in this small town in Indonesia. so what are you waiting for, let's go directly to balikpapan.",

      "text": "Balikpapan is a small city known as \"oil city\" and is the second largest city in East Kalimantan. This city is also often named as one of the most livable cities in Indonesia. As time goes by, Balikpapan is also growing in various sectors such as the economic sector, tourist sector, culinary sector, etc. Then, there are also many people who lives and visit Balikpapan. For me, this city is very beautiful and comfortable to live in. Various tourist spots such as Bekapai Park, Balikpapan Botanical Garden, Hutan Lindung Sungai Wain is very famous in this city. This city also has lots of good beaches such as Lamaru Beach, Kemala Beach, Manggar Beach, and many much more. What I like the most about this city is the culinary places that are very much various, delicious, and with very cheap prices, ranging from small stalls, street foods, and big restaurants, which serve really delicious food. One of the culinary places that I like the most is the street foods stall which are placed right in front of Melawai beach. This place is only open at night and there are so many choices of food for sale, such as fried rice, mie ayam, sekoteng, es campur, roasted corn, and many much more. From lots of varieties of food choices in there, I really like the spicy roasted corn the most ! A corn smeared with sweet butter, additional chili powder, then roasted in big fire makes this spicy roasted corn very delicious to eat at night. Overall, I highly recommend you all to visit this city. Even though this city is not big, this city provides lots of tourist attractions, culinary delights, malls, and more which are not far behind other big cities. If I had to give a rating of 1 out of 10 for this city, then I would give it an 11 out of 10. This city can be described with its own slogan which is 'Beriman' or its longness is Bersih, Indah, Aman, dan Nyaman.",

      "text": "The location isn‚Äôt hard to find, it only takes around 10 minutes from downtown. You can also use public transportation to go there (angkot is recommended because it is very affordable!). The beach is located on the left side of the road with a big welcome sign, so it‚Äôs easy to find. The entrance ticket is very affordable and comes with a bottle of mineral water because outside food and drinks are not allowed. Instead, you can go to the restaurant inside, which has a really nice setting. The restaurant sells at a reasonably high price, considering it is located around the beach area. The parking space is very spacious so you don‚Äôt have to worry when bringing your own vehicle. The beach has clean white sand, but the water is not crystal clear, like most beaches here. On weekdays, the beach is usually a place for teenagers and young adults to hang out with their friends. On weekends, typically Sundays, the beach is filled with families, some of which come from outside of the town. Personally, the beach feels more alive when used as family recreation! Overall, it‚Äôs a nice experience, a good choice for a temporary escape or healing. Will definitely come again! ",

Jika anda menemui pertigaan, lihat ke kanan bawah, jika jembatan ulin terlihat berarti anda harus Mengambil jalan yang menurun.\n\nDari pertigaan km 5.5 anda akan dihadapkan pada tanjakan yang menguras tenaga. Seringnya untuk saya, sepeda saya tuntun.\n\nJembatan ulin ini panjangnya sekitar 800 meter dan lebar 2 meter. Pemandangan kiri kanan jembatan sangat indah. Banyak perahu yang lalu lalang.\n\nSayangnya banyak papan jembatan yang lepas sehingga perlu kehati-hatian ekstra.\n\nSetelah puas beristiraht di jembatan, anda dapat menyewa perahu untuk menyebrang le Kampung Baru.

But I wish that I can meet the staff the work over here, so I could get some explanation regarding this garden and the trees also. It is recommended to bring food/snack if you want to stay over quiet longer.",

      "text": "Balikpapan is one of city in East Kalimantan, Balikpapan is known as an Oil city because it was once a producer of petroleum in the archipelago, although it does not produced again, but the city still got the crude oil refinery that belongs to Pertamina Company.\n\nBalikpapan have a lot of place to be visited, and one of the is the Bekapai Park which located in the center of Balikpapan city, this park is officially open for public on 28 October 1998. Based on my experience in visiting this park, for me this park is always  crowed before the covid-19 pandemic, especially in Saturday night, the view are amazing and I love to see the lights when the night came, the lights cover almost the whole park. I always loved to spend time relaxing there and in they also got a beautiful water fountain in the middle of the park, its a good spot for taking a picture and the design are very modern for teenagers. beside that, they also have many trees planted there and many people use to the tree to relax there. Bekapai Park also have many street foods that is served for people who felt starved there, my favorite dish at the Bekapai Park is the roasted corn, other than delicious, the price is really affordable and i can enjoy the roasted corn with a beautiful water fountain and the lights hanging on the tree at night. there are also Many street foods like Sekoteng, Fried rice, Tahu tek, and many more.\n\nThis is a perfect place to spend your time with your family or friends, I really recommended this place to  hang out because they got many stuff, from a pretty water fountain in the center, a beautiful lights at night, and also many street foods to enjoy.",

      "title": "Most Beautiful Park in Balikpapan",
      "text": "Bekapai Park is a well-known public tourist spot in Balikpapan which is located in the heart of the city, so it is very easy to visit. \n\nNot only a city icon, this park is also suitable for relaxing, relieve fatigue, and refreshing the mind while breathing cool and fresh air. The government does not charge any fee at all for people who visit this place. In fact, there are also free internet and food stalls selling at affordable prices. \n\nIn my opinion, the most appropriate time is in the afternoon to enjoy a beautiful sunset and at night accompanied by a beautiful fountain in the middle of the park. Colorful lights also adorn the oil monument which is located right by the fountain. This gives a very beautiful and interesting view, especially for taking pictures. This beauty is what I like the most about this place. There are quite a lot of shady trees planted, so anyone who comes can sit under them when they are tired of their activities. In addition, the cleanliness at Bekapai Park is very well maintained so it can spoil our eyes. There are many activities that can be done here, such as exercising or walking while carrying a pet.\n\nIt's just that what I don't like when visiting this place is the crowd. The facilities and views of this park make many local people visit it frequently. The lively atmosphere made me unable to really enjoy the beauty of this park.\n\nOverall, however, I would recommend you to visit this park at least once. You can come and spend time here with your loved ones, such as family, girlfriends, or friends at any time. I am sure you will not regret it as long as you choose the right time.",

The park is just located at the center of Balikpapan city, have many trees and street food vendors. If you read that this place has beautiful fountain that look like the spray of oil from an oil pump, but sadly I must tell you, that the fountain is broken, the spot light that supposed to create the impact of the oil spray don't have any bulb on the socket, it's look like been stolen as you can see the cable still hanging there. \nIn general I must say that the park is abandoned. The next day after my visit, a taxi driver told me that I should not go there, he didn't tell me why, though, but I agreed with him.",

It looks dry and rubbish around the area.\nAccross the monument area you will see also Kodam or Army base which is cleaner and neater! but I don't think you can go inside as it has very strict regulation. Just take pictures of its front look with Dayak shield. Beautiful!!",

Even though this monastery is not that big, but the good layout made it look pretty spacious.\n\nJust like other theravada buddhist temple, there is a weekly chanting with the buddhist fellowship here i supposed, so for tourists to come, it's better to confirm before coming and of course in a proper outfit. \n\nI stopped by without any notice, in Tuesday morning, there was no monk standby, no guard at all, just 2 workers busy with the job. I wished to get more information about this place actually, so it didn't feel useless, but maybe I could come again someday. I also hope the workers will clean the temple regularly in order to maintain this holy place.",

I'm amazed when seeing people treat the wooden bridge like it is a solid bridge because motorcycles are going back and forth on it (even I saw boys played football there!). I think sunset is the best time to visit, you can't resist to take some pictures.",

Another alternative is by taking speed boat to be at the accross island which takes only 10mnts drive and pay more about Rp.10,000. Pictures are worthed to take for this unique kampung!",

Disini kita bisa menikmati pemaandangan kapal-kapal penduduk yang lalu-lalang, jembatan kayu, sunrise, sunset, serta terkadang kalau sore hari banyak anak-anak yang mandi di laut. Kalau lagi beruntung saat sore hari kita juga bisa membeli udang ataupun ikan yang masih segar dari para nelayan yang baru pulang melaut.

Nasi met groenten wordt met vis geserveerd, expliciet gevraagd om niet spicy saus was het dus wel, en de kwaliteit van de vis was ronduit slecht!\nHet duurt ontzettend lang voordat je bestelling gebracht wordt.\n\nVan de wijnkaart met 51 wijnen, bleek nog maar 1 bestelbaar te zijn, de duurste van de hele kaart! \n\nIk zou hier alleen wat drinken voor de locatie en uitzicht en het daarbij laten.",

Pengamannya masih mempergunakan palang pintu. Bangunan ini terbuat dari kayu yang besar. Penyangganya adalah konstruksi batu yang dibuat lebih dari satu meter.Sehingga anak anak bisa bermain dibawahnya dengan aman. Saya pernah tinggal di bangunan seperti ini. Tapi letaknya di Dahor II no. 15. Sudah rata dengan tanah,karena bekas rumah saya itu sekarang didirikan apartemen untuk karyawan Pertamina.\nSaat ini bangunan ini disisakan beberapa oleh Pemerintah Kota balikpapan untuk dijadikan  Cagar Budaya. Dimana didalamnya kita bisa melihat lukisan beberapa bangunan tempo doeloe yang menggambarkan  Balikpapan masa lalu. Kita bisa melihat rumah bangsal yang merupakan rumah karyawan Pertamina, bentuknya seperti bangsal panjang. Disana tinggal banyak keluarga dengan berbagai cerita dan permasalahan.\nAnda ingi tau banyak tentang balikpapan ? yuk  ! kunjungi Dahor hritage. Oya...disebelahnya ada juga bangunan seruipa yang dibuat untuk perpustakaan.",

Some youngsters were occupying this place when i was visiting earlier this year, and they were not nice. It is definitely not  suitable for family or couple trip. The road is so small, if you want to go here, consider to get motorcycle instead of car. It will save you a lot of trouble.",

Im Wehea Reinforest kann man verschiedene Trekkingtouren durch den unber√ºhrten Wald machen und verschiedenste Tiere beobachten (wenn man Gl√ºck hat). Nach den Trekkingtouren kann man sich im direkt neben der Lodge befindlichen Bach erfrischen und sich die abgestorbene Haut von kleinen Fischen wegknabbern lassen. Zwar ist die Fahrt von Berau aus recht lang (ca. 4 Stunden nach Muara Wahau + nochmals 11/2 Stunden nach Wehea Forest), allerdings sollte man sich diese touristisch wenig erschlossene Gegend nicht entgehen lassen!",

      "text": "My partner and I reserved a 5D4N jungle tour. Budi, our tour guide, met us at the airport. We took a short taxi to the boat where we had fried plantains and drinks waiting for us. We met the captain, assistant captain, and cook who would be accompanying us on the journey. \n\nThe crew stayed on the bottom deck which is also where the bathroom is. We stayed on the top level of the boat (which has a mattress, table, and mosquito nets).  The top deck is open air, but impromptu shutters are made using tarps when it rains. \nThe open air top deck gives you amazing views of the jungle, river and wild-life. \n\nBudi gave an overview of our itinerary as we started our 1.5hr boat ride to the first camp. There are three camps, and each day we went to one or more of them. \n\nThe first day we trekked 4hrs in the jungle with the ranger and Budi. The trek is typically for longer stays. The trail was fairly flat with some large puddles and slippery portions. We travelled in Oct/Nov which is the shoulder season so we had rain once a day. The rains cooled down the air which made the hike very enjoyable. While we hiked, Budi and the ranger told us about local plants and wildlife. We took a speedboat canoe back to the boat. The canoe is low to the water so we saw great views.  This was one of our favorite parts of the trip.\n\nOnce we got back to the boat, lunch was waiting for us. The food was amazing and we had many different kinds of fruit with each meal. She made us authentic Indonesian food with less spice. \n\nLater in the day, we went to the viewing station to see the Orangutans. We spent 2hrs watching them eat and interact. It's truly amazing experience to see them. We saw close to 10-15 orangutans. Some of them would come very close. \n\nThe next three days, we would travel and dock at the other two camps. The third camp seems to be the most established. One our last full day, we went to two camps. In the second and third camps, we saw more wild orangutans, macaques, lemurs, bats, and even a crocodile. \n\nWe could not have been more grateful for the adventure. We highly recommend bringing hiking boots, mosquito spray (2 bottles), light-weight pants, a backpack, and a light rain jacket for trekking. If you are not trekking, we still recommend those items along with flip-flops and shorts for larger puddles. We also recommend bringing cash to tip the crew. We also appreciated carrying some body wipes.",

An excellent captain navigated us to different parts of tanjung puting national park. The boat assistant and cook were also amazing, efficiently managing the boat and served up amazing, simple yet delicious food. \n\nMonica shared so much history and context to the land and it's courageous people, and we spotted many wild organgutans and proboscis monkeys and even different birds along the way. We walked to different feeding stations to watch rehabilitated Orangutans at feeding time, and had a lovely walk through some beautiful forest with Udin, a local Ranger. We planted trees at Pesalat, and spent time with the Ranger Pedan there. \n\nWe appreciated a few specific things that made this trip really, really special: \n\n1. our boat captain NEVER chased down any animal we spotted, and in fact turned off the engine so we could observe the animals without disturbing them.\n\n 2. The boat was super clean and well maintained, and all our trash was collected in bins (and not dumped in the river!) \n\n3. All the staff maintained all SOPs and told us clearly about dos and don'ts. \n\n4. The tour groups have been slowly buying land on the river bank opposite the national park to ensure palm oil companies don't take over EVERY tiny bit of land available. \n\n5. This tour helps, supports and benefits locals (including and especially women), helping boost the local economy and preventing outmigration, which allows them to keep at their efforts to preserve and conserve the forests. \n\n6. The staff are paid well and fairly. \n\nDefinitely recommend this tour because i noticed at least one other tour boat (and two guides) chasing and disturbing animals to please their tourist. We also saw these two guides walking barefoot in the forest (against SOPs) and disturbing the Orangutans. \n\nWe were honoured to have met and talked with various people like rangers, and our guide and boat staff who loved and respected their work and the ongoing conservation efforts. \n\nOh, and as a bonus, we spotted a river dolphin right at the end of our tour! \n",

He suggested also places to go on Maratua Island alter the tour.\n\nThe tour itself was really great, perfectly organized, and as per the planned program. We have seen all the animals we dreamt to see, orangutans, probiscis monkeys, hornbill, tarentulas,...  \n\nBut what made the tour so brilliant was our guide and driver, Yansa and Ossay. They were really friendly, competent, safe and great cooks ! They took care of us perfectly, and always with a smile! Yansa has become a friend to the whole family and we thank him a lot for this great adventure !\n\nOur kids of 10, 8 and 6 were really pleased with the jungle treks, duration and effort. The accommodations and meals were fine, specially the night in tent next to the Nyadeng lake ! The only drawback was sometimes the duration of the car transfer between the sites, but this gives the opportunity to see a lot of Kalimantan.\n\nI would highly recommend this tour and the team at Borneo Eco Adventure !",

      "text": "We booked the ‚ÄúCross Borneo Trekking‚Äù. I had found them on the internet but there where no reviews about this trekking. I found some but they where more then 10 years old. So we finally just booked because the owner was so kind and answered al my questions almost imedeately and we where looking for a trip off the beaten track.We had an English speaking guide who picked us up at the airport. The next day we flew to Putussibau where we met the rest of the crew. The next day we left by boat with two guides (one who spoke English, one who knew the route) and a crew of two boatmen and 4 porters. After 2 days on the river we started the real trekking. The 2 boatmen left, took the boat back (against the current) and we had to carry our stuff in our backpacks for the next days. Luckily some of the porters took some heavy things from our backpacks. Every night we stoped at about 4 o‚Äôclock to build the next camp. The porters and guids made a fire place and cooked the best meals, some days we had fresh fish from the river. We crossed the river a lot of times and sometimes the current was very strong so we had to build a human chain to cross savely. Unfortunately we had very bad weather almost all day it rained very heavily so the rivers where strong and deep. Luckily we bought some simple rubber shoes on the market in Putussibau because our expensive water shoes were way to slippery.Becaus of the weather we needed an extra day to reach the destination and after a quiet scary last trip we reached this lovely little town. We met some people who where on a business trip, my boyfriend talked to them and they where leaving with a super fast boat to the next bigger city from where some car took us to the airport just in time to take a shower in the Hotel sleep 2 hours and catch the plane home. The whole trekking trip we really did not meet other people. It was extremely heavy and you really need some experience. But if you dare, JUST DO IT!The crew was great and some of them sometimes send pictures, still now after 1,5 years. I would not do it again but it absolutely is a trip I will never forget and we are proud we did this.Our trip was in August of 2017. ",

Our assigned guide Nurul perfectly guided us through the whole tour although being sick herself! She is such a friendly happy and inspiring person! Adie from Borneo Eco Adventure made sure no wishes were left open for us. He even considered our wish to have a vegetarian diet (which is not always easy in Borneo) and frequently talked to our guide about the progress of our tour! We felt save all the time and they really took great care of us! Exactly what we were hoping for a good price! You get what you book so don‚Äòt expect any luxury, but this wasn‚Äôt anything we were seeking for. Adie was prior to our trip in permanent contact with us answering patiently and always friendly all our major and minor questions (and we had a loooot). Communication with this agency was great! We happily recommend them! If you want to see wild Orangutans, Prosbiotic Monkeys, Crocodiles and a bunch of nighttime Insects go for them!",

This mall is known for facilities like the CGV movie theatre, Starbucks, McDonald's, Matahari, Borneo Bay, and many more. Borneo Bay, which is an apartment complex attached to the mall, is the place I often visit. The reason being my parents owning a few units in the apartment. On the other hand, I would go to Plaza Balikpapan to lounge and eat after I had helped my parents with cleaning up the apartment units. After I had eaten, I‚Äôd take a walk around the mall, which has a calmer atmosphere because it is not as crowded as E-walk or Pentacity. In contrast to the nice things about the mall, the only things that could be better is if they had more restaurants with higher qualities and more diverse stores.",

      "text": "Ibu Nila had been a very nice tour-guide by showing us the beauty of Mangrove Centre and Hutan Lindung Sungai Wain in a half-day trip. \n\nIbu Nila brought us to Mangrove Centre at 6 am in the morning, it was drizzle a little bit but she made sure we got our life jacket before hopping on the boat. She was also so friendly to my daughter, explained every detail to my 7 years-old girl patiently. During the mangrove trip using the boat, we found mud-skipper, crabs, heron, and the proboscis monkeys jumping on and off the tree's branches. We were also captivated by how mangrove reproduces using the long propagules which Ibu Nila showed to us.\n\nContinuing the journey with a short trekking to Hutan Lindung Sungai Wain, we met more fascinating plants! We saw the great banyan tree, bajakah tree, meranti, rotan, even the rare species of Borneo black orchid. Ibu Nila showed us the pristine water source, termites nest, kelulut nest, fungi etc. We also caught a glimpse of jumping lutung merah in between the trees.\n\nWe ended the trip by resting beside the water reservoir and hade a nice landscape view. If you want to have further trekking to the forest, you can ask Ibu Nila about trekking to Jamal point. Don't forget to visit the delicious Soto Lamongan in kilo 10 fur lunch. Thank you Ibu Nila!",

The reason we preffered Kutai National parc is because you can really see the Orang-Utangs in the wild and it's more of the beaten path. And the long journey for the two days in the jungle was so worth it. Nila organised the day before a nice tour in Balikbapan. She took us to a local sate place, which was amazing. The sunbear sanctuary wasn't really for us but we did like our boat tour through the mangrove. \nThe next day we went to Kutai. \nIts a long bumpy journey to get there, but our guide Iwan and our driver Yunos tried to make it as comfortable as possible\nEventually in the jungle we were the only tourists staying at the ranger camp with Heri and Ipe our hosts. Ipe cooked amazing food and sambal and Heri was an amazing ranger. Besides the great vibe there was around the camp we saw so many orang-utangs from up close. Because the camp is build around fruit trees you even have the chance of seeing them around the camp if you're lucky like we were. I think Awang told us we had a absolute record of 17 encounters in two days.  We were very lucky and we realise you can't plan nature! That said the jungle is still an amazing place to wander through and to wake up surrounded by the sound of rain and the birds in the jungle. Heri showed us special tries, mushrooms and all kinds of insects and other animals that he spotted. He is truly a great ranger and Awang is so fun as your guide. The whole trip was amazing! \n\nA big thank you to Nila, Awang, Heri, Ipe & Yunos. It was a trip of lifetime! ",

      "title": "AMAZING  2.5 Week trip through Kalimantan (East, South and Central)",
      "text": "When looking into Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan) it is certainly overwhelming. This is a vast land mass with many things to see. Nila made seeing it all seamless! From the planning phase through to the execution, Nila was active in recommendations and helping to build a trip that we would love. She worked for months with us iterating on itineraries to make sure the price and activities aligned with what we wanted. \n\nWe worked our way from southern Kalimantan through to the East. From the beginning we were picked up from the Airport by a very professional guide and a driver. The guides throughout our trip were a wealth of knowledge who were very personable, spoke excellent English and are very genuine people. As we travelled to different provinces we met new local guides from each area that all had a unique knowledge of the region. The guides that we had through out were all amazing people and we learned so much about the culture and the way of life as well as experiencing it first hand with them. It would have been impossible to travel the full route without their expertise. \n\nKalimantan has a aged infrastructure that has been overused by many industry vehicles leaving behind rough tight highways. Nila had arranged transportation throughout the trip. Each driver was confident, calm and collected along the drive. It takes an experienced driver who knows the roads day and night to travel the major distances. We felt safe in the hands of the drivers that we had. \n\nWe also enjoyed 2 sleeper boat excursions where the crew was friendly welcoming and all around great to travel with. They all had strong relationships with Nila and took great care of us. \n\nOverall we really enjoyed the experience of Kalimantan. We could not have seen this part of the world without the hard work of Nila and her local guides. We would recommend her company to anyone wanting to experience such a different and important part of Indonesia, and can‚Äôt wait to do it again!",

      "title": "5-day canoe tour along the Mahakam river",
      "text": "Review Nila\n\nMy dad and I traveled to Kalimantan for a few days in April 2018, hoping to take a break from other touristic islands in Indonesia and go on a hand crafted tour up the jungle, visiting remote villages and spotting wildlife along the way. We approached Nila after arriving in Balikpapan, when we found out we would have trouble visiting the Mahakam river on our own. A few hours after my email and when no other company had replied to us, we got a phone call to our hotel room at 9 PM : Nila had come to the hotel to talk about the options she could offer us. She was very attentive to our constraints of budget and time and she then sent a few packages by email later that night. We decided to take the ‚ÄúMahakam River backpacker trip‚Äù and she could even arrange to depart the next day. Our 5-day trip was a totally unique experience, meeting with local tribes, riding up the river with a very skilled canoe man (dotted with special x-ray eyes when it comes to spotting animals in the trees!), visiting traditional villages, encountering with monkeys, snakes and exotic bird species, and tasting the delicious local food specialties. All this led by our awesome guide, Djumri, a native of a Kutai tribe and also a descendant of the regency‚Äôs royal family. Djumri has been a fantastic person to meet and a very interesting and attentive guide, as well as speaking perfect English. He even managed to fulfill our need of raw veggies after eating so much deep fried stuff, haha. \nWe really enjoyed the trip, during which we were just the two of us plus our guide and sometimes our canoe man or a driver, which adds up to the reasons why we enjoyed it so much, since we were seeking exactly this kind of \"off the grid\" tourism experience. In many villages we visited we were the only foreigners the people had seen in weeks. Although it is a unique and quite enjoyable experience, it can sometimes feel uncomfortable for a young western woman in such conservative places, with locals clearly showing that they are not used to see people from my culture and customs, but our guide explained that he usually travels with older people which made it really surprising to see a younger ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù woman. I have never felt unsafe or endangered though, just bothered sometimes as a shy person. \nAnother aspect that could be addressed in order to deliver the greatest experience, at least in my personal opinion, would be to try and influence the local populations to reduce their waste. As in most countries in south east Asia, with no exception for these remote and traditional livings, people consume a lot of processed, packaged food. The packagings often end up in the river, and we saw monkeys playing amongst dirty diapers, plastic bottles and aluminum cans. I was expecting a more pristine, natural environment. If tourism could have a positive impact on making these populations aware of the importance of preserving their nature, it would be a huge progress. \nOverall, we had a really great time traveling with this tour. I hope to be able to do it again before Borneo gets more touristic, hopefully someday when the local populations start being more conscious of the importance of preserving their environment and prevent from wasting so much plastic packaging in the river :) This was by far the most authentic travel I got to experience and I hope the tour continues educating tourists to this kind of raw experiences. Thank you so much Nila and Djumri for such a beautiful trip in Kalimantan !",

Use something comfy and avoid too many accessories because the place is narrow and crowded, plus be cautious for pickpocket. If you were hungry in the middle of your shopping time, there are some seafood restaurants at the back, Haur Gading is famous.\n",

Ampiek batik, its a different type of batik that is native to Kalimantan Timur (pict 2)\n3. Bead handcraft, from necklaces to bags (pict 3).\n4. etc\n\nTips:\nWhen youre at Pasar Inpres Kebun Sayur dont be afraid to bargain, try at least til half of the price they first offered and be friendly. Its a local market anyway.",

After it had opened in 2009, the place was swarming with people wanting to visit the place. You might think now that in the pandemic this place will be empty, but on the contrary it is still full of people.\n\nThis place, which is full of shops, also has many other things to do such as a cinema, restaurants, entertainments and many more. I had been wanting to go back to this place since the beginning of the pandemic. Usually, places this big are hard to go around, but on the other hand there are many signs to show where places are.\n\nOverall this place is definitely my favourite place to go to in Balikpapan.",

So if you come to Balikpapan someday and looking for a mall, you will need to visit this place. BSB have so many things to do. The shopping center include clothings like shirt, shoes and many more. Beside that there are Supermarket, food and drinks, also fun station that can make you more enjoy your time. In the center of the mall, sometimes they held a show or maybe another shopping center. If you doubt to visit this mall because of corona, they also have protocol to avoid the spread of the virus. once you enter the hall, the security will check your body temperature and you can clean your hand with the sanitizer. If you bring your family to this trip you can go to Aquaboom in Pentacity which is beside the mall. This waterpark provide you gazebo for chilling also food. You can enjoy fun attraction or maybe a little scary. Not forgotten, Theatre to watch movies with family or friends. So I rated this place 4 out of 5 to visit because this place have so many things to do to refresh or relaxing your mind.",

      "text": "We are two NZ friends and frequent travellers who took a 4N5D Mahakam River and Kutai Park tour with Rimba Borneo, with guides Rusdy and Longfa April 2019. The trip was fantastic - made so by Rusdy's good organisation and the pair's great cooking. They were also a good laugh and relaxing to travel with.\n\nWe spent approx 2 nights and 1 day around the Mahakam River area, where the highlight was a day-long tour in a sturdy little wooden boat. There was lots to see around a series of rivers, lakes and communities. It was eye-opening and interesting to understand how the people living there made the best of the natural environment. Many lead a demanding life on houses on stilts or floating on the water or water's edge, with fishing and raising swiftlets for their nests the main earners on the water. Nearby there's also huge coal mines, with some eyebrow-raising barge loads passing incongruously along the river. Only similar thing we've seen are communities up the Amazon River from Leticia, Colombia to Peru, and to the floating fishermen villages in Halong Bay, Vietnam. But nothing on the scale there.\n\nUp one river surrounded by bush, it was possible to see a lot of proboscis monkeys and birds... we loved that. And not far from there, we had a good look round the beautiful old wooden Lamin Adat Mancong long house - a type of large communal home. \n\nOvernights were in more-populated villages in quirky but clean guest houses. The locals were smiley, relaxed and curious to see us, but didn't chat much other than asking for the occasional photo (we would have loved to sit with them and learn a craft or recipe to talk longer). We saw only one other tourist pair the whole time. Tourism definitely hasn't arrived yet.\n\nAfter one day's drive, seeing some interesting bush and different types of villages and the city of Samarinda out the window, we went to Kutai National Park. This is one of the areas where the Indonesian Government protects the habitat for orangutans. Access was via a similar little wooden boat, 20 mins motoring up a river and we stayed in the ranger's lodge with a ranger who had come to stay when we were there... that was a really cool element of the tour. \n\nThe lodge has a beautiful site and plenty of space, however is quite basic, so travellers need to be relaxed. We slept on clean sheets on old mattresses under mosquito nets in a private room that could sleep 3-4 at a squeeze. Washing was cold water, tap and bucket. It was fairly hot and noisey from animals in the surrounding jungle! (If you're the type of person worried about that... it's not for you).\n\nAround the lodge, we loved: The night walk to see all sorts of birds, bugs, frogs and spiders, then the 8am (easy) walk, where we found four orangutans having their morning tea in the wild, swinging round the trees. Watched them for 3-4 hours. Later, other animals showed up around the lodge, including macaques, a civet, monitor lizard.. loads to see. And there was good time for resting and reading books etc. While there, you have a ranger pretty much to yourself to show you everything.\n\nFood for the whole tour was absolutely delicious. A mix cooked by Rusdy or from rapid stops at restaurants. His treats included: omelettes, banana pancakes and copious fruit for breakfast; beautiful little fish with tasty toppings, battered chicken and noodles, loads of vegetables and huge prawns negotiated from the local fishermen for lunch and dinner. Vegetarians would be easily catered for. \n\nOur tour finished when we were dropped at Samboja Lodge.\n\nWe did a bunch of research to find tours which respected the natural environment and were very happy with this one. Highly-recommended",

Hanya bioskop yang masih eksis di Balcony City sedangkan stand lainnya hanya sekedar untuk menghabiskan masa sewa bahkan banyak yang sudah tutup. Jika anda ingin mengunjungi atau sekedar ingin menonton bioskop singgahlah ke Balcony City Balikpapan. Untuk mencapai lokasi ini dari terminal BP bisa naik angkot nomor 5 dan 6, sedangkan jika dari terminal Batu Ampar atau Pelabuhan Semayang bisa naik angkot nomor 3 turun di jembatan BC dan jalan sekitar 500m.

Jadi akhirnya membuat kita kurang semangat untuk kemari,",
