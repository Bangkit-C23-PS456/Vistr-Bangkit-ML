You can enjoy sincere and a little naive culture of the 'inner people', listen to their music and watch traditional dances and games. These people, of course, are just actors to satisfy the needs of visitors for smth exotic, but still they show their true arts.  If you have no chance to go to the inner areas and spend quite a lot of money to stay in a real village with dayak people, the visit to Pampang will be a marvelous choice for you. The only shade of scepticism was spilled on me with too much interaction with visitors, again to satisfy their needs for exotic things. But this is forgettable regarding to thje major part of the action. It is definitely worth visiting.",

It's not good for the kids personality development. But overall this actractions is good for cultural lover..\n\nThe Entry Ticket price is IDR 15,000 . I think it's cheap.

After the performance, you can take pictures with the kids or the elder Dayaks which will cost you another 25.000 rupiahs per shot. Look for the famous long ear woman, she might be the last Dayak woman with long ears; if you can't find her in the longhouse, look around, she might be mingling with other women selling souvenirs in the stalls in front of the house.\n\nIt's quite far to get here from the main road so you'd better take ojek (motor taxi) from the main gate.  If you are a bit more adventurous, once you pass the main gate from the main road, look on your right side. Approximately 1 KM you will see a real traditional long house with real Dayak people still living in it.",

However... This is Indonesia, thing ARE a little dirty sometimes. It didn't bother us although it can be sad to see how mining and palm oil plantations deplete all the nation treasures with so many people living in poverty.\n\nLucas, the (Dutch) owner of DeGigant was friendly and a good communicator. I was able to book the trip from back home which was a huge bonus because we lacked time to shop around in Balikpapan. Maybe you can get it for cheaper but we were very satisfied with the quality of the boat, staff and food.\n\nEvery day we took a small motorized canoe into the smaller side rivers to go to Dayak tribes and watch wildlife. What we liked best:\n1. The food. Anto, our chef was simply amazing putting together a new dish or dishes every night. Wow! A real culinary experience.\n2. The guide. Jai/Janai was super friendly and knowledgeable. He knew a lot of people in the area. Good English, great guide.\n3. The boat. Well maintained and for 2 people only very large. Airco at night, which was nice :). Also western toilet, shower.\n\nThe Dayak tribes & the nature was beautiful. I recommend this trip with DeGigant!",

Mosquito nets provided confidence.  The bathroom was basic, and just as described.  We had a private little balcony on the top deck, just outside our sleeping cabin. We are all tall, so we spent much of our time ducking low roofs.  That was all part of the experience.  \nThe communal dining area was perfect.  The food was fabulous.  The staff was very supportive, friendly and courteous at all times.\nWe loved all our visits to the various Dayak villages.  The people we met made us feel very, very welcome.  \nDavid was very respectful in all the villages we visited. We were lucky enough to happen upon wedding preparations in one village, where we were invited to help with the traditional feast preparations and attend the ceremony.  Sadly, we had a plane to catch the following day and could not stay long.\nThank you all for some wonderful experiences and very happy memories of our time on the Mahakam, Kalimantan.\nJill\n",

      "text": "My daughter and I took a cruise of three days and two nights down the Mahakam River with DeGigant Borneo Tours. The journey began when we were picked up from our hotel in Samarinda and taken to the boat.  It was large, extremely clean, and well furnished. There was a large bedroom on top with two double mattresses, clean linen, and mosquito net. Also, plug points for charging our phones and cameras, and a viewing deck with comfortable chairs. Below there was a dining table and chairs.  Besides plentiful and varied fare for breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner, we could help ourselves to tea and coffee, fruit and biscuits at any time we felt hungry.  There was a crew of three, the Captain and his assistants, a very sweet lady who cooked really amazing meals for us, and our guide who showed us everything possible and explained everything we wanted to know about, but at the same time, allowed us our privacy, too.\n\nWe had a western style toilet to ourselves with a hygiene faucet and flush. There was also a shower and a wash basin with mirror. All the water for washing and bathing purposes came from a freshwater tank on the boat.\n\nThe first day was just a leisurely progress down the Mahakam, taking in the river life and activities on both sides  -  some of it, like the loading of giant barges with coal, a depressing reminder of how the land is being exploited of natural resources.  The boat stopped at the pretty village of Muara Muntai during the night.  In the morning our guide took us on a tour of the village which has over 30 kms of boardwalk and unexpected facilities like a school, hospital and post office.  When we returned our canoe was waiting to take us across a massive lake, through intricate channels very difficult to negotiate, to a Dayak village with the longest longhouse in the province. Our boatman was brilliant at navigating the canoe and thanks to him and our guide, we were able to see many kinds of birds, tree snakes, monitor lizards, proboscis and other monkeys, and giant squirrels. It was excitement all the way in looking out for wildlife and taking photographs.\n\nWhen we reached the Dayak village, we were given a tour of the beautiful longhouse with exquisite carvings.  The Dayak tribe showed us many dances and we took part in a couple, which was great fun. We were also shown how to use an actual blowpipe to shoot arrows and then we were annointed with rice paste according to tradition.  A lovely, gentle people. They do some fine embroidery and we bought a piece for framing later on. The cook had thoughtfully packed lunch for us because by the time we made the return journey, it was late evening.  I was very impressed with the compassion of the boatman, who stopped to free a baby monkey which had been caught in a trap. \n\nWe started the journey back, reaching our drop-off point at Tenggarong after breakfast the next morning. Our guide took us ashore to visit the Sultan's Palace which has been made into a well-planned and interesting museum. We finished our tour just before lunch time and a car was waiting to take us to Balikpapan, where we were going to spend the night.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the cruise and besides hundreds of photos we have happy memories of the lovely people we met.",

      "text": "My daughter and I recently took an 8-day, 7 night boat trip up the Mahakam River in East Kalimintan.  We booked our trip with Didier Waegemans, a Belgian who is a partner Mundooz Borneo Adventure Tours.  Didier was very knowledgeable and helpful and promptly responded to my inquiries throughout the planning process.  He arranged the tour with De gigant Tours Borneo out of Samarinda, and fixed us up with an excellent, well-regarded guide named Jailani.  We were provided with a beautiful, spotlessly clean boat with a crew of five who took care of our every need.  The chef on board was terrific and cooked three delicious and perfectly cooked multi-course meals every day.  We had the whole top of the boat to ourselves, which included our air-conditioned bedroom with a couple of thick mattresses on the floor, and a lovely veranda at the front of the boat where we could watch the world go by.\n\nThe tour itself was fascinating, but it is not what it used to be.  Rather than seeing people living in longhouses in remote, traditional communities, these days the region is in the process of transformation.  Kalimantan provides 25% of Indonesia’s GDP and so economic migration and resource extraction are rampant.  Tugboats pull untold numbers of huge coal barges worth hundreds of thousands of dollars down river, and enormous rafts of hardwoods float downstream towards their Asian markets.  Dozens of speed boats ply the river, full of workers heading back and forth from their jobs.  The villages still process many commodities in traditional ways, including salt fish, baskets, woven cloth, wood carvings, palm sugar and sago, among others, and the processes used are astonishing to see.  Wildlife  still exists within and alongside the river, including Irrawaddy dolphins, monkeys of various kinds, and many beautiful birds.  We took a number of shorter trips in motorized canoes, which were great fun, and there was no end of interesting sites along the way.  The people were absolutely lovely, especially our guide Jailani, who has thorough knowledge of the area, as well as many relatives and friends in the various villages along the route.\n\nWe enjoyed every moment of our trip, and learned so much about Indonesia and the various Dayak cultures in this region.  Indonesian people are among the friendliest in the world, and it was a very special treat to spend our time immersed in this rich natural and cultural world.  Indonesia is developing rapidly, and while the days of the headhunters are long gone, seeing the cultural transformation of a people in such a short time is breathtaking.  I would highly recommend this trip for anyone; it was a rich and unforgettable experience.",

Not everyone can enter this place, but if you wish, please ask the guard or the worker for permissions. \n\nIt is a must to wear proper clothing when come to this place (no shorts, no sleeveless), and for tourist, please make a call to get the information before coming, in case there is a ceremony and the temple is not ready to take a guest.\n\n",

Precisely what I've been thinking about this place, it's to expensive just to enter this constantly, consistently, unchanging Lampions.. you know what I mean.. from the 1st time it opened the Lampions is just the same. \nBut hey c'mon, there's a lot of joyful ride like in the carnival.. yes they have rides/games but i have to pay more to enjoy every ride they provide there.\nSo, this place is wonderful for you that never been to this place or you that for the first time visiting Samarinda and want to have instagramable picture.

Because from what I know, Samarinda Central Plaza(SCP) is the only mall that has cinema and located in the middle of the town center.\nSCP also has a department store that is quite big in Samarinda, alongside Matahari Department Store, called Ramayana Department Store. They offer goods with prices cheaper than Matahari Department Store. But I personally prefer Matahari Department Store. Although if you're looking for school shoes, I would say Ramayana.\nSCP has bookstore named Karisma. The price offered is quite cheap.\nAt the top floor there are a karaoke place called Happy Puppy and a chinese restaurant called Ong Palace.\nAnd like any other mall, this mall ha fun centers for family and kids, called Fun City and Amazon. Since I was liittle, I always loved to come and play here. Because there were so many variety of games. It was so hard to get bored in here!",

I would recommend him.\n\nOur low rating is more about the trip itself. As with many trips in borneo, the 4d, 3n description isn’t particularly accurate. You spend 1.5 days in Kutai national park, 2 days travelling. Kutai national park is not particularly beautiful and the jungle is not in great condition. We did see three wild orangutans, but no other wildlife. \n\nThe motor canoe is a brief trip (1hr) up a local river to spot crocodiles. There is plenty of rubbish in the river and will only see crocodiles if the tide is right. \n\nThe research station is newly built, simple, but clean. It is worth noting that there is only electricity from mid afternoon until 11:30pm, so sleeping can be challenging in the heat and the middle of the day was quite intense. Thee is no fridge or ice on the premises. Food was very basic. \n\nThe hotel in Samarinda on the final night was quite nice.\n\nAll in all, we wished we had spent more time elsewhere as we experienced much better jungle elsewhere.",

We think lonely planet (2013) has to stop their advice because of the problems with this organisation: no life jacket with sailing on the wild river with ces and no good preparation for health condition in the jungle. we have said that Lucas Zwaal should have to informe him with Kiri Travel our good jungle experience the week before. I didn't get the idea that he will take his measures in this way......",

Most of the shops that I've seen there are mostly shops that sell imported stuff and shops that already have famous brands. That's why most of the price are quite expensive.\nI would suggest to shop your wardrobe at Matahari Department Store. If you're smart and patience enough to search for discounts or promo, you will get the best deal at Matahari.",
